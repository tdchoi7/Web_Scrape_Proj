They were both so stubborn and rude and refused to take a moment to realize that the cashier had rang in one item twice resulting in an extra $5. Instead, the Manager told me I had to consider the tax because I'm in Massachusetts and not down South. I'm not from the South, so not sure what her point was, but we'd already agreed the tax was $1.30.

My daughter and I felt a bit left out and miffed. Hence my 3 star review since this is more geared towards children.

After we got off the ship we were in the back area of the building, where the lady came back to speak to us about the participants in the Boston Tea Party. After that we went into the museum to learn more history and see an actual tea box that was preserved. However, we were not allowed to take pics.

We had it included with our hop on/off bus tickets. We arrived and they have showings throughout the day. Possibly every half hour. We went straight in. They partly replay parts and you watch some on screens. You go on a boat and throw a padded box over the side, to resemble throwing the tea over board. Overall it was fairly interesting, and it was good to learn a little more about it. They have a very good gift shop and tea shop with cakes. Look for sale items.\n",

Historic Tours of America, Inc. an entertainment company. They charge $29 to go inside. You are first treated to two actors who yell out a script about the \"origins\" of the American split with the British (I guess for those who never got past the second grade), then you are whisked to a ship look alike and herded through the place. You can hurl fake tea bundles into the bay (although they tell you this was not done - they had to open the bundles to pour out the tea, go figure). Next you are quickly escorted into a dark room where holograph figures yell at you. Next you are marched into a room where they show you the one artifact in this \"museum\": as actual crate from the Tea Party. You then hear two paintings yell and argue. The next room has a film (stand) about the first shot of the American Revolution before being forced upstair to the gift shop and overpriced tea room. Total Time 30 minutes (not counting the time in the gift shop)\n",

It is pretty fake with all the folks dressed up in 16th century clothes but it ir a bit cheesy for me. The 2 sailing boats look great, the gift shop is cool but my over-riding feeling was \"cheesy\"! We did not pay to do the tossing of the tea over the side of the ship thing!\n",

I attempted to purchase three items in the gift shop, two priced at $4.99 and one at $5.99. When the girl at the register rang up the items at a total of $22 and change, I suggested that something was wrong. She disagreed and didn't understand that $5 +$5 + $6= $16, plus approximately $1.30 in tax should total $17 and change, not $22. When the Manager came over and reviewed the transaction, she insisted that the computer was right. They were both so stubborn and rude and refused to take a moment to realize that the cashier had rang in one item twice resulting in an extra $5. Instead, the Manager told me I had to consider the tax because I'm in Massachusetts and not down South. I'm not from the South, so not sure what her point was, but we'd already agreed the tax was $1.30. She gave me a few choices, over-pay for the merchandise, buy tickets for the boat-tour (most likely a rip-off), or leave. I left, disappointed that these retail employees were unable to complete simple math and treat customers so badly.\n",

The costumes are elaborate and the staff are friendly and helpful. The gift shop was really fun. The \"tea\" is not really tea that they throw off the side, but this is likely due to the fact that throwing tea into the harbor would be really bad for the environment.\n",

Just when you think it's going to end, it doesn't. I was hoping that by taking the tour, I'd learn a lot about the Boston Tea Party, but unfortunately, the tour guides who were in \"character\" the entire time, didn't engage my attention at all. It was like watching a bad play for an hour and a half. The positive thing about the tour was getting to go on the replicas of the ships.... and then there was a film at the end, which was the only interesting \"adult\" thing about the tour. The gift shop is also pretty nice. Other than that, there isn't too much to say about this...\n",
       "22943  We opted for this trip as add on to our trolley tour. Since my daughter is going into the 5th grade and they will be studying this history, I thought it would be neat for her to experience it and learn some things. You first enter a sitting hall where the realistic experience begins. A woman (Rebecca Hodge) dressed in period wear was greeting each family giving out character cards. She would speak to each family making fun conversation with the kids....except for us! I know my daughter and I were only a family of 2 but there was no reason to basically ignore us. My daughter and I felt a bit left out and miffed. Hence my 3 star review since this is more geared towards children. After getting hyped by Samuel Adams, we were all ushered to the ship where a young gentleman gave us a tour and let us throw tea over board! He was to listen to. After we got off the ship we were in the back area of the building, where the lady came back to speak to us about the participants in the Boston Tea Party. After that we went into the museum to learn more history and see an actual tea box that was preserved. However, we were not allowed to take pics. Lastly we saw a film about the events that led to the Revolutionary War and then we were let out into Abigail's Tea Room. They also have a great gift shop with some neat items. So depending on whom you get as your tour guide, it can make a difference.\n",

In fairness, we did this visit as a side note to touring a lot of other Boston history sites, so we were not really prepared to pay the ticket prices for the tea party experience. To get the full power, I would come with money to do the Boston tea party experience, eat a few things from Abigail's tea room, and have some money to spend in the gift shop.\n",

The role play by actors in costumes was frankly embarrassing (British reserve I guess) and so little history about what actually happened and its significance. We all found the shouty actors irritating after a while, and the one exhibit in the museum just made us laugh - a tea chest on a rotating podium with spotlights, behind glass. Really? The crown jewels in the Tower of London have less fanfare than that. The film was really good though (no shouting) but the talking portraits were frankly silly. The portrayal of King George was laughable and comedic - not suitable for a historic museum and a bit insulting I thought (although understandable given the context I guess). Sorry guys, this place is clearly aimed at a domestic audience and to be fair the US visitors seemed to love it. However we just didn't enjoy it and the whole experience left us cold and irritable. Great gift shop though with the best selection we saw anywhere in Boston, so not a complete letdown :-)\n",

The replica ships are nice, but the interactive experience was not our cup of tea (pun intended). Maybe if we had children, we would have enjoyed it more. For us, an adult couple, it felt pretty awkward. There was a lot of waiting around (awkwardly) to go from one thing to the next. The gift shop was the best part for us, and we discovered we could have accessed it without participating in the tour, if we had just bypassed the ticket sales. I think many people would enjoy the option of simply viewing the replica ship (self-paced), briefly seeing the tea chest, and watching the video at an admission cost more consistent with other Boston historic sites.\n",

There is a gift shop at the end where you can purchase some items and a tea shop where you can sample the tea.\n",

Instead watched from a nearby pier as they tossed the tea bundles off one of the ships and took a few photos. Spent 10 minutes in the gift shop that were selling mostly cheap imported trinkets and souvenirs at greatly inflated prices! Think we made the right choice!\n",

Tour was informative but they put far too many people in the groups and most people (mainly Americans) Just don't shut up and listen. Shame really as they could learn a lot as Actors were good, interaction was good and pace of tour was good. Would have been much better if we could have heard everything though.\n",

So much so we opted not to do the official tour, just had a bite to eat in the associated cafe instead. Well stocked rather expensive gift shop. The USS Constitution was a better 'old ship' experience.\n",

The outlier is an invented amusement at a site near (not at) where colonists dressed as native Americans and threw boxes of surplus, dumped tea into the harbor at low tide. The attraction includes costumed actors, a video or two, talking portraits, a throwing of retrievable boxes overboard and a gift shop. Itâ€™s historically accurate and interesting. Itâ€™s perfect if you know nothing about history and have young children. Otherwise see the real stuff with the pros.\n",

Pretty happy we didn't pay the money to through a box into the water just to pull it back up. We just watched, had some tea and looked at the gift shop.

There were people participating in the tea party, by throwing large square 'bales of tea' overboard. I believe they paid to go onboard to tour the real looking ship and participate in the revolution. The staff were dressed in historically appropriate attire and kids would probably really get a kick out of doing this. We checked out the gift shop too, but overall it just wasn't my 'cup of tea'. We did walk close by to a waterfront seafood restaurant that was great but when the rain picked up it was a chilly (yummy) meal under their tent.\n",

However it would be great for children to learn the story in this setting and the tour did sound great fun.\n",

Visitors are encouraged to participate with cheers and boos, so be prepared. You are taken through key events either by the actors or through high-tech multimedia performances. You get to visit one of 2 ships which were involved in the tea party to experience life in the 1770s. The whole tour lasts just over an hour but it all felt very rushed and highly organised, as visitors are shepherded from one event to the next. There was not enough time to read and digest the displays on the wharf. It was definitely a money-making enterprise with the object being to push tours through to the gift shop and the tea room."

       "'had to to this for our visit to boston. we had it included with our hop on/off bus tickets. we arrived and they have showings throughout the day. possibly every half hour. we went straight in. they partly replay parts and you watch some on screens. you go on a boat and throw a padded box over the side, to resemble throwing the tea over board. overall it was fairly interesting, and it was good to learn a little more about it. they have a very good gift shop and tea shop with cakes. look for sale items. the ship is fun to look at, but the ceremony and costumers were quite cheesy. the gift shop is better than average. the employees were great. this is run by (for profit?) historic tours of america, inc. an entertainment company. they charge $29 to go inside. you are first treated to two actors who yell out a script about the \"origins\" of the american split with the british (i guess for those who never got past the second grade), then you are whisked to a ship look alike and herded through the place. you can hurl fake tea bundles into the bay (although they tell you this was not done - they had to open the bundles to pour out the tea, go figure). next you are quickly escorted into a dark room where holograph figures yell at you. next you are marched into a room where they show you the one artifact in this \"museum\": as actual crate from the tea party. you then hear two paintings yell and argue. the next room has a film (stand) about the first shot of the american revolution before being forced upstair to the gift shop and overpriced tea room. total time 30 minutes (not counting the time in the gift shop) intended to visit the museum but a lot of school trips so just went to the gift shop and tea shop. would definitely recommend a visit to the tea shop. ok - you have to go there as it is globally famous. it is pretty fake with all the folks dressed up in 16th century clothes but it ir a bit cheesy for me. the 2 sailing boats look great, the gift shop is cool but my over-riding feeling was \"cheesy\"! we did not pay to do the tossing of the tea over the side of the ship thing! stay away! i attempted to purchase three items in the gift shop, two priced at $4.99 and one at $5.99. when the girl at the register rang up the items at a total of $22 and change, i suggested that something was wrong. she disagreed and didn\\'t understand that $5 +$5 + $6= $16, plus approximately $1.30 in tax should total $17 and change, not $22. when the manager came over and reviewed the transaction, she insisted that the computer was right. they were both so stubborn and rude and refused to take a moment to realize that the cashier had rang in one item twice resulting in an extra $5. instead, the manager told me i had to consider the tax because i\\'m in massachusetts and not down south. i\\'m not from the south, so not sure what her point was, but we\\'d already agreed the tax was $1.30. she gave me a few choices, over-pay for the merchandise, buy tickets for the boat-tour (most likely a rip-off), or leave. i left, disappointed that these retail employees were unable to complete simple math and treat customers so badly. this was fun to see and would likely be really great for small children. the costumes are elaborate and the staff are friendly and helpful. the gift shop was really fun. the \"tea\" is not really tea that they throw off the side, but this is likely due to the fact that throwing tea into the harbor would be really bad for the environment. i wish i could have said i loved every minute of this tour, but i didn\\'t. just when you think it\\'s going to end, it doesn\\'t. i was hoping that by taking the tour, i\\'d learn a lot about the boston tea party, but unfortunately, the tour guides who were in \"character\" the entire time, didn\\'t engage my attention at all. it was like watching a bad play for an hour and a half. the positive thing about the tour was getting to go on the replicas of the ships.... and then there was a film at the end, which was the only interesting \"adult\" thing about the tour. the gift shop is also pretty nice. other than that, there isn\\'t too much to say about this... we opted for this trip as add on to our trolley tour. since my daughter is going into the 5th grade and they will be studying this history, i thought it would be neat for her to experience it and learn some things. you first enter a sitting hall where the realistic experience begins. a woman (rebecca hodge) dressed in period wear was greeting each family giving out character cards. she would speak to each family making fun conversation with the kids....except for us! i know my daughter and i were only a family of 2 but there was no reason to basically ignore us. my daughter and i felt a bit left out and miffed. hence my 3 star review since this is more geared towards children. after getting hyped by samuel adams, we were all ushered to the ship where a young gentleman gave us a tour and let us throw tea over board! he was to listen to. after we got off the ship we were in the back area of the building, where the lady came back to speak to us about the participants in the boston tea party. after that we went into the museum to learn more history and see an actual tea box that was preserved. however, we were not allowed to take pics. lastly we saw a film about the events that led to the revolutionary war and then we were let out into abigail\\'s tea room. they also have a great gift shop with some neat items. so depending on whom you get as your tour guide, it can make a difference. booked tickets online through viator. timed slots work well. great insight into the history. guides were knowledgeable but the show is all staged. lovely tea room and gift shop. would recommend. the experiencing of being in the harbor where such a significant event in history took place was awesome, the rest of it, not so much. in fairness, we did this visit as a side note to touring a lot of other boston history sites, so we were not really prepared to pay the ticket prices for the tea party experience. to get the full power, i would come with money to do the boston tea party experience, eat a few things from abigail\\'s tea room, and have some money to spend in the gift shop. sorry guys but we really didn\\'t like this museum. the role play by actors in costumes was frankly embarrassing (british reserve i guess) and so little history about what actually happened and its significance. we all found the shouty actors irritating after a while, and the one exhibit in the museum just made us laugh - a tea chest on a rotating podium with spotlights, behind glass. really? the crown jewels in the tower of london have less fanfare than that. the film was really good though (no shouting) but the talking portraits were frankly silly. the portrayal of king george was laughable and comedic - not suitable for a historic museum and a bit insulting i thought (although understandable given the context i guess). sorry guys, this place is clearly aimed at a domestic audience and to be fair the us visitors seemed to love it. however we just didn\\'t enjoy it and the whole experience left us cold and irritable. great gift shop though with the best selection we saw anywhere in boston, so not a complete letdown :-) to be fair, we had not read any reviews and had no idea what to expect when we purchased the tickets for this. the replica ships are nice, but the interactive experience was not our cup of tea (pun intended). maybe if we had children, we would have enjoyed it more. for us, an adult couple, it felt pretty awkward. there was a lot of waiting around (awkwardly) to go from one thing to the next. the gift shop was the best part for us, and we discovered we could have accessed it without participating in the tour, if we had just bypassed the ticket sales. i think many people would enjoy the option of simply viewing the replica ship (self-paced), briefly seeing the tea chest, and watching the video at an admission cost more consistent with other boston historic sites. we went and did this tour to hear about the history and see the replica of the ships. it was filled with information which was very nice. you get to take pictures of your throwing replica blocks of tea overboard. there is a gift shop at the end where you can purchase some items and a tea shop where you can sample the tea. took a cab from quincy market thinking it would be fun to tour the tea party museum and the ships but at $28 for the 30 minutes we had available, thought it to be a bit much. instead watched from a nearby pier as they tossed the tea bundles off one of the ships and took a few photos. spent 10 minutes in the gift shop that were selling mostly cheap imported trinkets and souvenirs at greatly inflated prices! think we made the right choice! over priced gift shop to start and end the tour. tour was informative but they put far too many people in the groups and most people (mainly americans) just don\\'t shut up and listen. shame really as they could learn a lot as actors were good, interaction was good and pace of tour was good. would have been much better if we could have heard everything though. this was the most touristy of the attractions we visited in boston. so much so we opted not to do the official tour, just had a bite to eat in the associated cafe instead. well stocked rather expensive gift shop. the uss constitution was a better \\'old ship\\' experience. we were able to wander through the gift shop, use the bathrooms, and spy on the ship for free. nice staff and very clean. the bakery smelled amazing. the great historical sites in boston are very capably managed by the national park service. the outlier is an invented amusement at a site near (not at) where colonists dressed as native americans and threw boxes of surplus, dumped tea into the harbor at low tide. the attraction includes costumed actors, a video or two, talking portraits, a throwing of retrievable boxes overboard and a gift shop. itâ€™s historically accurate and interesting. itâ€™s perfect if you know nothing about history and have young children. otherwise see the real stuff with the pros. so, i thought my family and i would enjoy the museum. pretty happy we didn\\'t pay the money to through a box into the water just to pull it back up. we just watched, had some tea and looked at the gift shop. still a good place to stop and the actors seemed into it. we went on a rainy september wednesday around lunchtime. there were people participating in the tea party, by throwing large square \\'bales of tea\\' overboard. i believe they paid to go onboard to tour the real looking ship and participate in the revolution. the staff were dressed in historically appropriate attire and kids would probably really get a kick out of doing this. we checked out the gift shop too, but overall it just wasn\\'t my \\'cup of tea\\'. we did walk close by to a waterfront seafood restaurant that was great but when the rain picked up it was a chilly (yummy) meal under their tent. we didn\\'t pay the $30 for the tour but the gift shop is very good and there are nice views of the ships for photos, bit of a tourist trap and being british we didn\\'t want to take the blame for history !! however it would be great for children to learn the story in this setting and the tour did sound great fun. this tour, led by actors in period costume, re-enacts events leading up to, and after the boston tea party. visitors are encouraged to participate with cheers and boos, so be prepared. you are taken through key events either by the actors or through high-tech multimedia performances. you get to visit one of 2 ships which were involved in the tea party to experience life in the 1770s. the whole tour lasts just over an hour but it all felt very rushed and highly organised, as visitors are shepherded from one event to the next. there was not enough time to read and digest the displays on the wharf. it was definitely a money-making enterprise with the object being to push tours through to the gift shop and the tea room.'"

We had it included with our hop on/off bus tickets. We arrived and they have showings throughout the day. Possibly every half hour. We went straight in. They partly replay parts and you watch some on screens. You go on a boat and throw a padded box over the side, to resemble throwing the tea over board. Overall it was fairly interesting, and it was good to learn a little more about it. They have a very good gift shop and tea shop with cakes. Look for sale items.\n",

Historic Tours of America, Inc. an entertainment company. They charge $29 to go inside. You are first treated to two actors who yell out a script about the \"origins\" of the American split with the British (I guess for those who never got past the second grade), then you are whisked to a ship look alike and herded through the place. You can hurl fake tea bundles into the bay (although they tell you this was not done - they had to open the bundles to pour out the tea, go figure). Next you are quickly escorted into a dark room where holograph figures yell at you. Next you are marched into a room where they show you the one artifact in this \"museum\": as actual crate from the Tea Party. You then hear two paintings yell and argue. The next room has a film (stand) about the first shot of the American Revolution before being forced upstair to the gift shop and overpriced tea room. Total Time 30 minutes (not counting the time in the gift shop)\n",

It is pretty fake with all the folks dressed up in 16th century clothes but it ir a bit cheesy for me. The 2 sailing boats look great, the gift shop is cool but my over-riding feeling was \"cheesy\"! We did not pay to do the tossing of the tea over the side of the ship thing!\n",

I attempted to purchase three items in the gift shop, two priced at $4.99 and one at $5.99. When the girl at the register rang up the items at a total of $22 and change, I suggested that something was wrong. She disagreed and didn't understand that $5 +$5 + $6= $16, plus approximately $1.30 in tax should total $17 and change, not $22. When the Manager came over and reviewed the transaction, she insisted that the computer was right. They were both so stubborn and rude and refused to take a moment to realize that the cashier had rang in one item twice resulting in an extra $5. Instead, the Manager told me I had to consider the tax because I'm in Massachusetts and not down South. I'm not from the South, so not sure what her point was, but we'd already agreed the tax was $1.30. She gave me a few choices, over-pay for the merchandise, buy tickets for the boat-tour (most likely a rip-off), or leave. I left, disappointed that these retail employees were unable to complete simple math and treat customers so badly.\n",

The costumes are elaborate and the staff are friendly and helpful. The gift shop was really fun. The \"tea\" is not really tea that they throw off the side, but this is likely due to the fact that throwing tea into the harbor would be really bad for the environment.\n",

Just when you think it's going to end, it doesn't. I was hoping that by taking the tour, I'd learn a lot about the Boston Tea Party, but unfortunately, the tour guides who were in \"character\" the entire time, didn't engage my attention at all. It was like watching a bad play for an hour and a half. The positive thing about the tour was getting to go on the replicas of the ships.... and then there was a film at the end, which was the only interesting \"adult\" thing about the tour. The gift shop is also pretty nice. Other than that, there isn't too much to say about this...\n",
       "22943    We opted for this trip as add on to our trolley tour. Since my daughter is going into the 5th grade and they will be studying this history, I thought it would be neat for her to experience it and learn some things. You first enter a sitting hall where the realistic experience begins. A woman (Rebecca Hodge) dressed in period wear was greeting each family giving out character cards. She would speak to each family making fun conversation with the kids....except for us! I know my daughter and I were only a family of 2 but there was no reason to basically ignore us. My daughter and I felt a bit left out and miffed. Hence my 3 star review since this is more geared towards children. After getting hyped by Samuel Adams, we were all ushered to the ship where a young gentleman gave us a tour and let us throw tea over board! He was to listen to. After we got off the ship we were in the back area of the building, where the lady came back to speak to us about the participants in the Boston Tea Party. After that we went into the museum to learn more history and see an actual tea box that was preserved. However, we were not allowed to take pics. Lastly we saw a film about the events that led to the Revolutionary War and then we were let out into Abigail's Tea Room. They also have a great gift shop with some neat items. So depending on whom you get as your tour guide, it can make a difference.\n",

In fairness, we did this visit as a side note to touring a lot of other Boston history sites, so we were not really prepared to pay the ticket prices for the tea party experience. To get the full power, I would come with money to do the Boston tea party experience, eat a few things from Abigail's tea room, and have some money to spend in the gift shop.\n",

The role play by actors in costumes was frankly embarrassing (British reserve I guess) and so little history about what actually happened and its significance. We all found the shouty actors irritating after a while, and the one exhibit in the museum just made us laugh - a tea chest on a rotating podium with spotlights, behind glass. Really? The crown jewels in the Tower of London have less fanfare than that. The film was really good though (no shouting) but the talking portraits were frankly silly. The portrayal of King George was laughable and comedic - not suitable for a historic museum and a bit insulting I thought (although understandable given the context I guess). Sorry guys, this place is clearly aimed at a domestic audience and to be fair the US visitors seemed to love it. However we just didn't enjoy it and the whole experience left us cold and irritable. Great gift shop though with the best selection we saw anywhere in Boston, so not a complete letdown :-)\n",

The replica ships are nice, but the interactive experience was not our cup of tea (pun intended). Maybe if we had children, we would have enjoyed it more. For us, an adult couple, it felt pretty awkward. There was a lot of waiting around (awkwardly) to go from one thing to the next. The gift shop was the best part for us, and we discovered we could have accessed it without participating in the tour, if we had just bypassed the ticket sales. I think many people would enjoy the option of simply viewing the replica ship (self-paced), briefly seeing the tea chest, and watching the video at an admission cost more consistent with other Boston historic sites.\n",

Spent 10 minutes in the gift shop that were selling mostly cheap imported trinkets and souvenirs at greatly inflated prices! Think we made the right choice!\n",

Tour was informative but they put far too many people in the groups and most people (mainly Americans) Just don't shut up and listen. Shame really as they could learn a lot as Actors were good, interaction was good and pace of tour was good. Would have been much better if we could have heard everything though.\n",

The outlier is an invented amusement at a site near (not at) where colonists dressed as native Americans and threw boxes of surplus, dumped tea into the harbor at low tide. The attraction includes costumed actors, a video or two, talking portraits, a throwing of retrievable boxes overboard and a gift shop. Itâ€™s historically accurate and interesting. Itâ€™s perfect if you know nothing about history and have young children. Otherwise see the real stuff with the pros.\n",

Pretty happy we didn't pay the money to through a box into the water just to pull it back up. We just watched, had some tea and looked at the gift shop.

There were people participating in the tea party, by throwing large square 'bales of tea' overboard. I believe they paid to go onboard to tour the real looking ship and participate in the revolution. The staff were dressed in historically appropriate attire and kids would probably really get a kick out of doing this. We checked out the gift shop too, but overall it just wasn't my 'cup of tea'. We did walk close by to a waterfront seafood restaurant that was great but when the rain picked up it was a chilly (yummy) meal under their tent.\n",

When the Manager came over and reviewed the transaction, she insisted that the computer was right. They were both so stubborn and rude and refused to take a moment to realize that the cashier had rang in one item twice resulting in an extra $5. Instead, the Manager told me I had to consider the tax because I'm in Massachusetts and not down South. I'm not from the South, so not sure what her point was, but we'd already agreed the tax was $1.30.

Since my daughter is going into the 5th grade and they will be studying this history, I thought it would be neat for her to experience it and learn some things. You first enter a sitting hall where the realistic experience begins. A woman (Rebecca Hodge) dressed in period wear was greeting each family giving out character cards. She would speak to each family making fun conversation with the kids....except for us! I know my daughter and I were only a family of 2 but there was no reason to basically ignore us. My daughter and I felt a bit left out and miffed. Hence my 3 star review since this is more geared towards children. After getting hyped by Samuel Adams, we were all ushered to the ship where a young gentleman gave us a tour and let us throw tea over board! He was to listen to. After we got off the ship we were in the back area of the building, where the lady came back to speak to us about the participants in the Boston Tea Party. After that we went into the museum to learn more history and see an actual tea box that was preserved. However, we were not allowed to take pics. Lastly we saw a film about the events that led to the Revolutionary War and then we were let out into Abigail's Tea Room. They also have a great gift shop with some neat items.

The role play by actors in costumes was frankly embarrassing (British reserve I guess) and so little history about what actually happened and its significance. We all found the shouty actors irritating after a while, and the one exhibit in the museum just made us laugh - a tea chest on a rotating podium with spotlights, behind glass. Really? The crown jewels in the Tower of London have less fanfare than that. The film was really good though (no shouting) but the talking portraits were frankly silly. The portrayal of King George was laughable and comedic - not suitable for a historic museum and a bit insulting I thought (although understandable given the context I guess). Sorry guys, this place is clearly aimed at a domestic audience and to be fair the US visitors seemed to love it. However we just didn't enjoy it and the whole experience left us cold and irritable.

For us, an adult couple, it felt pretty awkward. There was a lot of waiting around (awkwardly) to go from one thing to the next. The gift shop was the best part for us, and we discovered we could have accessed it without participating in the tour, if we had just bypassed the ticket sales.

It was definitely a money-making enterprise with the object being to push tours through to the gift shop and the tea room.</td>\n",

We had it included with our hop on/off bus tickets. We arrived and they have showings throughout the day. Possibly every half hour. We went straight in. They partly replay parts and you watch some on screens. You go on a boat and throw a padded box over the side, to resemble throwing the tea over board. Overall it was fairly interesting, and it was good to learn a little more about it. They have a very good gift shop and tea shop with cakes. Look for sale items.\n",

Historic Tours of America, Inc. an entertainment company. They charge $29 to go inside. You are first treated to two actors who yell out a script about the \"origins\" of the American split with the British (I guess for those who never got past the second grade), then you are whisked to a ship look alike and herded through the place. You can hurl fake tea bundles into the bay (although they tell you this was not done - they had to open the bundles to pour out the tea, go figure). Next you are quickly escorted into a dark room where holograph figures yell at you. Next you are marched into a room where they show you the one artifact in this \"museum\": as actual crate from the Tea Party. You then hear two paintings yell and argue. The next room has a film (stand) about the first shot of the American Revolution before being forced upstair to the gift shop and overpriced tea room. Total Time 30 minutes (not counting the time in the gift shop)\n",

It is pretty fake with all the folks dressed up in 16th century clothes but it ir a bit cheesy for me. The 2 sailing boats look great, the gift shop is cool but my over-riding feeling was \"cheesy\"!

I attempted to purchase three items in the gift shop, two priced at $4.99 and one at $5.99. When the girl at the register rang up the items at a total of $22 and change, I suggested that something was wrong. She disagreed and didn't understand that $5 +$5 + $6= $16, plus approximately $1.30 in tax should total $17 and change, not $22. When the Manager came over and reviewed the transaction, she insisted that the computer was right. They were both so stubborn and rude and refused to take a moment to realize that the cashier had rang in one item twice resulting in an extra $5. Instead, the Manager told me I had to consider the tax because I'm in Massachusetts and not down South. I'm not from the South, so not sure what her point was, but we'd already agreed the tax was $1.30. She gave me a few choices, over-pay for the merchandise, buy tickets for the boat-tour (most likely a rip-off), or leave. I left, disappointed that these retail employees were unable to complete simple math and treat customers so badly.\n",

The costumes are elaborate and the staff are friendly and helpful. The gift shop was really fun. The \"tea\" is not really tea that they throw off the side, but this is likely due to the fact that throwing tea into the harbor would be really bad for the environment.\n",

Just when you think it's going to end, it doesn't. I was hoping that by taking the tour, I'd learn a lot about the Boston Tea Party, but unfortunately, the tour guides who were in \"character\" the entire time, didn't engage my attention at all. It was like watching a bad play for an hour and a half. The positive thing about the tour was getting to go on the replicas of the ships.... and then there was a film at the end, which was the only interesting \"adult\" thing about the tour. The gift shop is also pretty nice. Other than that, there isn't too much to say about this...\n",
       "22943  We opted for this trip as add on to our trolley tour. Since my daughter is going into the 5th grade and they will be studying this history, I thought it would be neat for her to experience it and learn some things. You first enter a sitting hall where the realistic experience begins. A woman (Rebecca Hodge) dressed in period wear was greeting each family giving out character cards. She would speak to each family making fun conversation with the kids....except for us! I know my daughter and I were only a family of 2 but there was no reason to basically ignore us. My daughter and I felt a bit left out and miffed. Hence my 3 star review since this is more geared towards children. After getting hyped by Samuel Adams, we were all ushered to the ship where a young gentleman gave us a tour and let us throw tea over board! He was to listen to. After we got off the ship we were in the back area of the building, where the lady came back to speak to us about the participants in the Boston Tea Party. After that we went into the museum to learn more history and see an actual tea box that was preserved. However, we were not allowed to take pics. Lastly we saw a film about the events that led to the Revolutionary War and then we were let out into Abigail's Tea Room. They also have a great gift shop with some neat items. So depending on whom you get as your tour guide, it can make a difference.\n",

In fairness, we did this visit as a side note to touring a lot of other Boston history sites, so we were not really prepared to pay the ticket prices for the tea party experience. To get the full power, I would come with money to do the Boston tea party experience, eat a few things from Abigail's tea room, and have some money to spend in the gift shop.\n",

The role play by actors in costumes was frankly embarrassing (British reserve I guess) and so little history about what actually happened and its significance. We all found the shouty actors irritating after a while, and the one exhibit in the museum just made us laugh - a tea chest on a rotating podium with spotlights, behind glass. Really? The crown jewels in the Tower of London have less fanfare than that. The film was really good though (no shouting) but the talking portraits were frankly silly. The portrayal of King George was laughable and comedic - not suitable for a historic museum and a bit insulting I thought (although understandable given the context I guess). Sorry guys, this place is clearly aimed at a domestic audience and to be fair the US visitors seemed to love it. However we just didn't enjoy it and the whole experience left us cold and irritable. Great gift shop though with the best selection we saw anywhere in Boston, so not a complete letdown :-)\n",

The replica ships are nice, but the interactive experience was not our cup of tea (pun intended). Maybe if we had children, we would have enjoyed it more. For us, an adult couple, it felt pretty awkward. There was a lot of waiting around (awkwardly) to go from one thing to the next. The gift shop was the best part for us, and we discovered we could have accessed it without participating in the tour, if we had just bypassed the ticket sales. I think many people would enjoy the option of simply viewing the replica ship (self-paced), briefly seeing the tea chest, and watching the video at an admission cost more consistent with other Boston historic sites.\n",

There is a gift shop at the end where you can purchase some items and a tea shop where you can sample the tea.\n",

Instead watched from a nearby pier as they tossed the tea bundles off one of the ships and took a few photos. Spent 10 minutes in the gift shop that were selling mostly cheap imported trinkets and souvenirs at greatly inflated prices! Think we made the right choice!\n",

Tour was informative but they put far too many people in the groups and most people (mainly Americans) Just don't shut up and listen. Shame really as they could learn a lot as Actors were good, interaction was good and pace of tour was good. Would have been much better if we could have heard everything though.\n",

So much so we opted not to do the official tour, just had a bite to eat in the associated cafe instead. Well stocked rather expensive gift shop. The USS Constitution was a better 'old ship' experience.\n",

The outlier is an invented amusement at a site near (not at) where colonists dressed as native Americans and threw boxes of surplus, dumped tea into the harbor at low tide. The attraction includes costumed actors, a video or two, talking portraits, a throwing of retrievable boxes overboard and a gift shop. Itâ€™s historically accurate and interesting. Itâ€™s perfect if you know nothing about history and have young children. Otherwise see the real stuff with the pros.\n",

Pretty happy we didn't pay the money to through a box into the water just to pull it back up. We just watched, had some tea and looked at the gift shop.

There were people participating in the tea party, by throwing large square 'bales of tea' overboard. I believe they paid to go onboard to tour the real looking ship and participate in the revolution. The staff were dressed in historically appropriate attire and kids would probably really get a kick out of doing this. We checked out the gift shop too, but overall it just wasn't my 'cup of tea'. We did walk close by to a waterfront seafood restaurant that was great but when the rain picked up it was a chilly (yummy) meal under their tent.\n",

Visitors are encouraged to participate with cheers and boos, so be prepared. You are taken through key events either by the actors or through high-tech multimedia performances. You get to visit one of 2 ships which were involved in the tea party to experience life in the 1770s. The whole tour lasts just over an hour but it all felt very rushed and highly organised, as visitors are shepherded from one event to the next. There was not enough time to read and digest the displays on the wharf. It was definitely a money-making enterprise with the object being to push tours through to the gift shop and the tea room."

As you enter the room, a lady dressed in that era greeted us and handed us cards-showing what character we were assigned. We were also handed feathers symbolizing the disguise made so they won't be recognized if caught. You get to keep the cards and feathers at the end of the tour. We were supposed to relive a town hall meeting regarding taxation without representation -and went aboard a replica of the ship where the tea were kept. Got a sort of reenactment of how the tea were dumped in the ocean. Video clips were also shown in the museum. The tour guide was in character throughout the tour.

Since my daughter is going into the 5th grade and they will be studying this history, I thought it would be neat for her to experience it and learn some things. You first enter a sitting hall where the realistic experience begins. A woman (Rebecca Hodge) dressed in period wear was greeting each family giving out character cards. She would speak to each family making fun conversation with the kids....except for us! I know my daughter and I were only a family of 2 but there was no reason to basically ignore us. My daughter and I felt a bit left out and miffed. Hence my 3 star review since this is more geared towards children. After getting hyped by Samuel Adams, we were all ushered to the ship where a young gentleman gave us a tour and let us throw tea over board! He was to listen to. After we got off the ship we were in the back area of the building, where the lady came back to speak to us about the participants in the Boston Tea Party. After that we went into the museum to learn more history and see an actual tea box that was preserved. However, we were not allowed to take pics. Lastly we saw a film about the events that led to the Revolutionary War and then we were let out into Abigail's Tea Room. They also have a great gift shop with some neat items.

An enormous amount of arts and history pieces are waiting for you to be translated in front of you. My 5 dollars audio guide battery was handed out not fully charged. I only noticed when I dived myself into the art pieces. It was such a hassle to rewind your journey in between and forward when you are middle of enjoying something and you donâ€™t want it interrupted. Very few of the numbers on the art pieces were damaged or missing ( probably with kids? ) so I wasnâ€™t able to listen to audio guide sadly. Audio guide was rather a collection of reading some boring descriptions compared to my experience from Van Gogh museum in Amsterdam or Casa BatllÃ³ in Barcelona. Their audio guide feels like more personalized guided tour through the journey within the museums. Some musical and dramatic elements and a great storytelling make audience experience much more enjoyable. You can find some interactive display that teaches you some stuff which I find it educational. Like mentioned above it is a huge collection so better plan your journey according to your priority.</td>\n",

I was excited to see the tea party ship, but was told this ship had just been built to the same scale. We did get to tour the ship after their little show. The tour guides are dressed up and speak (and pretend) like they are from the 1700s. I think KIDS will like this a lot. For adults IMO I think it's an hour I would have rather spent on a tour bus or seeing the state house.   \n",

It is on the left side of the Children's museum and close to the area for the tour to MIT. We get a discount from purchasing the trolley tour so we decided to might as well tour the museum. As you enter the room, a lady dressed in that era greeted us and handed us cards-showing what character we were assigned. We were also handed feathers symbolizing the disguise made so they won't be recognized if caught. You get to keep the cards and feathers at the end of the tour. We were supposed to relive a town hall meeting regarding taxation without representation -and went aboard a replica of the ship where the tea were kept. Got a sort of reenactment of how the tea were dumped in the ocean. Video clips were also shown in the museum. The tour guide was in character throughout the tour. Overall an okay tour if you want a piece of history.   \n",

The guides try hard to engage everyone but I found the chat all very samey and it got a bit boring. Need more interactive elements and the museum had one item in it, a tea box, not much of a museum really! Trying hard to be like Disney and failing. I love history but this left me cold! Abigail's tea room at the end however is excellent, $5.95 for bottomless mug of tea, five types to try and a souvenir mug to take home. Great Value! Don't do this tour if you are on a budget. Duck tour or USS constitution much better.   \n",

Just when you think it's going to end, it doesn't. I was hoping that by taking the tour, I'd learn a lot about the Boston Tea Party, but unfortunately, the tour guides who were in \"character\" the entire time, didn't engage my attention at all. It was like watching a bad play for an hour and a half. The positive thing about the tour was getting to go on the replicas of the ships.... and then there was a film at the end, which was the only interesting \"adult\" thing about the tour. The gift shop is also pretty nice. Other than that, there isn't too much to say about this...   \n",
       "22943  We opted for this trip as add on to our trolley tour. Since my daughter is going into the 5th grade and they will be studying this history, I thought it would be neat for her to experience it and learn some things. You first enter a sitting hall where the realistic experience begins. A woman (Rebecca Hodge) dressed in period wear was greeting each family giving out character cards. She would speak to each family making fun conversation with the kids....except for us! I know my daughter and I were only a family of 2 but there was no reason to basically ignore us. My daughter and I felt a bit left out and miffed. Hence my 3 star review since this is more geared towards children. After getting hyped by Samuel Adams, we were all ushered to the ship where a young gentleman gave us a tour and let us throw tea over board! He was to listen to. After we got off the ship we were in the back area of the building, where the lady came back to speak to us about the participants in the Boston Tea Party. After that we went into the museum to learn more history and see an actual tea box that was preserved. However, we were not allowed to take pics. Lastly we saw a film about the events that led to the Revolutionary War and then we were let out into Abigail's Tea Room. They also have a great gift shop with some neat items. So depending on whom you get as your tour guide, it can make a difference.   \n",

While it was interesting to walk the trail of history, unless you are with someone steeped in it, I suggest one of the guided tours. I also highly recommend visiting the Boston Public Library for one of the most beautiful mural displays. Itâ€™s totally free and a must see!It is also across the street from a beautiful church and lots of shopping!   \n",

I expected to find an audio tour on this topic, and there was none. The collections seemed a bit random, and too often I was missing an explanation in the differentiation from European Art. For some rooms this was not the case, and the explanations were good and interesting, and these were the rooms I enjoyed the most.   \n",

And my experience with MFA was not so entertaining. Especially the audio guide. An enormous amount of arts and history pieces are waiting for you to be translated in front of you. My 5 dollars audio guide battery was handed out not fully charged. I only noticed when I dived myself into the art pieces. It was such a hassle to rewind your journey in between and forward when you are middle of enjoying something and you donâ€™t want it interrupted. Very few of the numbers on the art pieces were damaged or missing ( probably with kids? ) so I wasnâ€™t able to listen to audio guide sadly. Audio guide was rather a collection of reading some boring descriptions compared to my experience from Van Gogh museum in Amsterdam or Casa BatllÃ³ in Barcelona. Their audio guide feels like more personalized guided tour through the journey within the museums. Some musical and dramatic elements and a great storytelling make audience experience much more enjoyable. You can find some interactive display that teaches you some stuff which I find it educational. Like mentioned above it is a huge collection so better plan your journey according to your priority.   \n",

As much as I loved finally being in the room with Degas, Monet and Renoir, it took us exploring for nearly 2 hours to feel truly inspired. I was quite disappointed, in all honesty.   \n",

Perhaps I should have gotten a guidebook, but really there should be a self guided walking tour app for smart phones.

We did get to tour the ship after their little show. The tour guides are dressed up and speak (and pretend) like they are from the 1700s. I think KIDS will like this a lot. For adults IMO I think it's an hour I would have rather spent on a tour bus or seeing the state house.\n",

      "We bought a hop on hop off old town trolley tour and we decided to get off on the stop in front of the Museum. It is on the left side of the Children's museum and close to the area for the tour to MIT. We get a discount from purchasing the trolley tour so we decided to might as well tour the museum. As you enter the room, a lady dressed in that era greeted us and handed us cards-showing what character we were assigned. We were also handed feathers symbolizing the disguise made so they won't be recognized if caught. You get to keep the cards and feathers at the end of the tour. We were supposed to relive a town hall meeting regarding taxation without representation -and went aboard a replica of the ship where the tea were kept. Got a sort of reenactment of how the tea were dumped in the ocean. Video clips were also shown in the museum. The tour guide was in character throughout the tour. Overall an okay tour if you want a piece of history.\n",

Need more interactive elements and the museum had one item in it, a tea box, not much of a museum really! Trying hard to be like Disney and failing. I love history but this left me cold! Abigail's tea room at the end however is excellent, $5.95 for bottomless mug of tea, five types to try and a souvenir mug to take home. Great Value! Don't do this tour if you are on a budget.

I was hoping that by taking the tour, I'd learn a lot about the Boston Tea Party, but unfortunately, the tour guides who were in \"character\" the entire time, didn't engage my attention at all. It was like watching a bad play for an hour and a half. The positive thing about the tour was getting to go on the replicas of the ships.... and then there was a film at the end, which was the only interesting \"adult\" thing about the tour.

      "We opted for this trip as add on to our trolley tour. Since my daughter is going into the 5th grade and they will be studying this history, I thought it would be neat for her to experience it and learn some things. You first enter a sitting hall where the realistic experience begins. A woman (Rebecca Hodge) dressed in period wear was greeting each family giving out character cards. She would speak to each family making fun conversation with the kids....except for us! I know my daughter and I were only a family of 2 but there was no reason to basically ignore us. My daughter and I felt a bit left out and miffed. Hence my 3 star review since this is more geared towards children. After getting hyped by Samuel Adams, we were all ushered to the ship where a young gentleman gave us a tour and let us throw tea over board! He was to listen to. After we got off the ship we were in the back area of the building, where the lady came back to speak to us about the participants in the Boston Tea Party. After that we went into the museum to learn more history and see an actual tea box that was preserved. However, we were not allowed to take pics. Lastly we saw a film about the events that led to the Revolutionary War and then we were let out into Abigail's Tea Room. They also have a great gift shop with some neat items. So depending on whom you get as your tour guide, it can make a difference.\n",

      "This museum was unique and very informative about the rich history of the event known as the Boston Tea Party. It was fun to pose for pictures on top of the ship with the crates of tea too. We were very rushed though and my visitors (one of them didnâ€™t speak English) wanted to take *lots* of pictures and so we didnâ€™t get an opportunity to spend enough time on top of the ship. The tour is timed so after going below, we had to rush off to the next area (indoors) for a re-enactment of more of the history. We were locked in there and then after you have to go to the next area. The next 2 areas are a short film and a room with a cool talking display between historical figures, again you are locked in those rooms. For visitors who donâ€™t speak English, itâ€™s tough. They fell asleep because of their severe jet lag. I guess I should have done more research. I also wouldnâ€™t bring younger children. So all in all, the guides are excellent actors and it is a cool experience, but I donâ€™t think I would do this again unless my kids had a history project or they were old enough to sit still for a while and appreciate the rich history and sacrifice/bravery of the colonists.\n",

      "This is the feedback I sent to the museum about my experience. I have yet to hear back from them. To whom it may concern, I am a 4th and 5th grade public school teacher who visited your museum this summer. I would like to write to you today to share some of my thoughts about my experience while attending this museum with friends this summer. To begin, there were several great things I took away from this experience. The constant moving around the museum, as well as the tactile experiences of reenacting the tea being thrown into the harbor, were really engaging experiences. I attended this museum with an 8 year old, and he loved this part of it. I also really appreciated how the museum laid out the chain of events that occured after the tea party. Within the context provided by the museum experience, it was clear to participants the importance and incredible risk this act posed during Colonial times for those involved. Although there were things I enjoyed about the museum experience, two things deeply bothered me. The first was the fact that as participants in the museum, we were given feathers, so that if need be, we could disguise ourselves as Mohawk Indians. I know that this is a historically accurate representation of this event, and I understand that a major purpose of this museum experience is to reenact, with as many layers of authenticity as possible, the events that took place in Boston Harbor that night. That being said, we do not live in a vacuum. We live in a broader historical context. It is 2018. I can see no way to justify having an audience made up of people living in the year of 2018 reenact the racism of the past. I did talk to my tour guide about this, and this guide did say that the disguise at the time was not meant to offend or disrespect the Mohawk tribe. She also said that none of the colonists had ever met a member of the Mohawk tribe before deciding to dress in this costume with a feather. She said they chose to use the feathers because it was an important symbol to the tribe. I would like to know more about your sources for this information, because I am skeptical of it. If indeed the colonists were not intending to disrespect the Mohawk Tribe with their disguise - which I find hard to believe, considering the tense and bad relationship that existed at that time between colonists and Native Americans - it is still a racist act, even considering the context of 1773. Even more so, in 2018, this act is incredibly racist. Other visitors of the museum were wearing their feathers in their hair during the tour. How would a person of Native descent feel about experiencing this part of the museum? How is it ok to let people engage in a racist act - wearing feathers in an attempt to look like a Native American - so that they can \"better experience\" the event of the Boston tea party? It is not ok, and it misinforms the public. People could very easily leave this experience feeling that it is ok to make light of both this treatment towards and false representation of Native Americans. The second topic I was bothered by was a topic completely left out of the whole museum experience - the topic of slavery. How can a museum about Colonial America fail to include the topic of slavery? I understand that slavery was different in the Northern colonies compared to the Southern colonies. However, it was an essential part of Colonial America. You cannot understand Colonial America without considering it as a whole, and slavery is too huge a piece to leave out. It may be an uncomfortable topic to discuss, especially considering how the colonists were comparing themselves as slaves to Britain during this time (this was a quote I heard during my museum experience), but it is a necessary topic to include. Omitting it not only blatantly misinforms the public, but also wastes an opportunity to explore some of the unpleasant and contradictory truths about the American fight for independence from Britain. I write this to you because we can do better. We must do better. As a museum intended to educate the public, these two points I raised are highly problematic and must be taken into consideration. I write this as an educator, but also as a person who attended this museum with people of color, and specifically a young person of color. How do you think he felt about this museum experience? How do you think other people of color would feel? If we continue to perpetuate misperceptions about groups of people, specifically groups of people of color, racism and ignorance will also be perpetuated. As educators, it is our duty to address racism and ignorance. Your museum experience perpetuated this. I write this to you in hopes that you will take my criticism seriously so that you can improve your museum experience for all potential museum visitors.\n",

      "I came here with my niece and nephew (5&3) and I think that most of the experience was lost on them. The guides at the museum kept talking to them and telling stories and explaining things in a way that was way too complicated for them to understand and I guess I had figured that they would know how to simply things age-appropriately? When our group threw the tea overboard on the boat, my nephew started crying because he didnâ€™t get to do it. None of the staff noticed and got another box for him to throw â€” it was really odd. Instead, we pulled a box back in so that he could do it. Another thing thatâ€™s kind of weird is that they provide you with feathers as a â€œdisguiseâ€ for the tour but donâ€™t explain the historical context around that. There is some cool tech stuff, so overall I think it would be better for older kids.\n",

      "My wife and I were on a trip to Boston sightseeing and was looking forward to visiting this attraction. We paid $59 for both of us and of all the things that we did on our three week trip to New England this was by far the biggest waste of money. The tour starts in a mock up of the Old Meeting house and is conducted by two role playing guides. The whole presentation is aimed at young children - probably 5 to 10 year olds - fair enough but we hoped we would be able to read the info in the exhibits. However, the issue is that everything is rushed and the very few things to read/look at that are in the \"museum\" you are not given time to take in. When we went out to the boat the guide gave his talk on the top deck and then asked everybody to go down to the next deck where he would continue the tour. There were two sets of stairs going down but we were told we could only use one. We were at the back of a large group, thirty or forty people, and by the time we had filed downstairs the guide was already half way through his talk so we missed it (no waiting allowed as they have to clear the room for the next group). After the talk the group were very quickly led around the lower deck in single file and back up the other stairs - no time to really look at anything. We then went on the quayside for another short discourse from the guide where there were some poster exhibits to read. However, by the time we filed off the boat at the back of the group we were told to move on and did not have time to read any of the exhibits. This happened throughout the rest of the \"tour\". The whole thing lasted less than an hour and was a total waste of time and money! Give this a miss - your time is much better spent exploring many of the other excellent attractions in Boston especially the Navy Dockyard where you get as much time as you want to spend on two real boats!\n",

I admire the fact that they have maintained the ballpark in the same location since 1912. I live in the Dallas/Fort Worth area and the Rangers are building a new park after only twenty years. So much for tradition. Now, as far as the tour, it was fairly unimpressive. This was more like a \"pick your seat\" day. All you did was walk around the seats and look at the stadium/field from different vantage points. That's great and should be part of the tour, but it left us wanting more. You don't get to see anything you couldn't see by just buying a game ticket. Didn't get on the field or in the dugouts, dressing rooms, broadcast booths, suites, underneath inner workings. Nothing but walk around in the stands. You will get a little bit of history about the Red Sox and the Stadium from the tour guide, but still left wanting more. This is the most historic Stadium in baseball, it should have a tour to match!\n",

Everything we saw (with the exception of the visitors locker room and the print media room) you can see and view if you had a game day ticket.

Nick, our tour-guide was quite knowledgeable and likable. Our problems with the tour was that it was too rushed and too crowded. My wife and I are in our seventies and not as nimble as we once were. Nick, as good as he was, often times left, not only ourselves, but many people far behind. There was one point where our entire tour group was wandering around looking for him. He eventually, noticing that he was alone, came back for us. Also, a bit disappointed that the Pesky Pole was not a part of the tour. Now game time. We purchased tickets online weeks ahead. Grandstand 15, row 1 seats 1 & 2. No mention that seat one has a pillar in front of it, blocking out half the field. NOT HAPPY! Not to worry though, as a diehard Sox fan who seldom gets to Fenway, we will return again but, order tickets from an actual person.\n",

I would have liked to learn about Fenway's construction....Who were the workers who built it? What did it cost to construct? What VIPS attended games? How about a tour of the Dug Out and Locker Room when the team is on the Road. There was a fund raiser on the field the day I went. Better to close the tour and let us tourists walk the warming track, See the Bull Pen, Hear from the score keepers who post the runs, strikes and outs from inside the Score Board. Although elevators exist which I needed to get around the stadium I was ushered around the building separately from the tour guide and group as a whole. I appreciated the consideration however a knowledgeable alternate tour guide would have been desirable, Overall, my experience was a 6.5 on scale of 10 for want of some the missing elements I mention above and the possibility of missing more of what the tour guide had to say after being ushered away from the group.

      "After reading some other reviewers comments we decided to do the Freedom Trail without a guide as we were only in Boston for the day and wanted to be able to walk the whole trail from beginning to end. It is a lot of walking so be sure to wear comfortable shoes! I was glad we did not make a reservation in advance as we had problems getting to Boston from the train and took us longer than expected so we would of missed our time so by us doing self guided tour it worked out fine. We started at what we thought was the Boston Common, but some how didn't start where we wanted to so had to do some back tracking. We saw what you would of seen if you did the \"Walk into History\" and \"North End\" tours. It was nice as we could go at our own pace and take a lot of pictures. If I did it again the next time I would do a guided tour so I got a little more history and understood what I was looking at without having to google it on my phone.\n",

      "So far as I can tell the freedom trail has no theme. It merely directs tourists through Boston to a few free venues and a few pay venues. It also entices tourists to buck up $14 for a 'guided' tour of the trail (that doesn't go to the USS Consititution or Bunker Hill). This is really something that you can skip in its entirety or go see the few things that might be interesting to you. I see this as more of an attempt by local tourism to create a demand for a product.\n",

However we were very disappointed as the tour guide interjected much of her own personal viewpoints and political thoughts into our nation's history along the tour. Much of her deviation from our country's history was highly skewed, if not completely false. The trail with the tour guide was a huge disappointment and we wished we had just done the walk without a guide. Save your money and just buy a map.\n",

We knew that my wheelchair would not be able to go everywhere. I don't remember our guides name, but he was not good. He gave too much unimportant info and not enough basic history of each stop. He went over time by 20 minutes because of it. We did not tip him and he sarcastically said, \"Thanks for the generosity\" when we were walking away. I would skip the tour and go to each stop on my own. Research ahead of time where to go in a wheelchair because the visitor center was no help.\n",

No explanation was given for the short tour but was charged full rate. It is for this reason that I give an average rating.

      "The Freedom Trail is a designated pedestrian route through central Boston, which takes you from the Common, through different areas of the town centre, past various landmarks, parks and monuments. Although paid guided tours are available, it can be just done as a self-guided walk. It's a pleasant walk, not too far and a good way to navigate through the city. Unfortunately, while the route itself is well marked by a continuous line on the floor, there are limited information boards or signs to alert you to what the points of interest are. Also, each venue on the route is individually managed and there's no co-ordination between them in terms of ticketing so while each may only be $10-20, for a family of 4 it quickly adds up to $70 plus! We didn't bother, but it was a nice enough walk!\n",

On my most recent trip, history was brought to life for me by my amazing Freedom Trail Foundation (FTF) tour guide \"Lydia\". Engaging and full of knowledge, I learned more from her in one hour than I did in several years of school. HOWEVER, I was very concerned about her voice as our tour drew to a close. After having to yell at top volume to a group of 20+ tourists in open spaces for over an hour just to be heard, I could hear the hoarseness in her voice. I was then HORRIFIED to learn that FTF refuses to let their guides use microphones, to ease some of this strain. Most of these guides are artists and actors (which is why their tours and stories are so good) and I'm sure the daily damage takes it's toll. I also learned that guides don't get sick days and often have to work in extreme heat (100+ degrees) and cold--again causing damage to their bodies and voices! FTF should be ashamed of treating their employees so poorly when they are the very pulse of the company! Their hard work is what brings in the tourists and the dollars. I would feel uncomfortable taking another tour with FTF, unless I knew their employees were being treated more humanely!\n",

An enormous amount of arts and history pieces are waiting for you to be translated in front of you. My 5 dollars audio guide battery was handed out not fully charged. I only noticed when I dived myself into the art pieces. It was such a hassle to rewind your journey in between and forward when you are middle of enjoying something and you donâ€™t want it interrupted. Very few of the numbers on the art pieces were damaged or missing ( probably with kids? ) so I wasnâ€™t able to listen to audio guide sadly. Audio guide was rather a collection of reading some boring descriptions compared to my experience from Van Gogh museum in Amsterdam or Casa BatllÃ³ in Barcelona. Their audio guide feels like more personalized guided tour through the journey within the museums. Some musical and dramatic elements and a great storytelling make audience experience much more enjoyable. You can find some interactive display that teaches you some stuff which I find it educational. Like mentioned above it is a huge collection so better plan your journey according to your priority.\n",

       "\"The Freedom Trail is a designated pedestrian route through central Boston, which takes you from the Common, through different areas of the town centre, past various landmarks, parks and monuments. Although paid guided tours are available, it can be just done as a self-guided walk. It's a pleasant walk, not too far and a good way to navigate through the city. Unfortunately, while the route itself is well marked by a continuous line on the floor, there are limited information boards or signs to alert you to what the points of interest are. Also, each venue on the route is individually managed and there's no co-ordination between them in terms of ticketing so while each may only be $10-20, for a family of 4 it quickly adds up to $70 plus! We didn't bother, but it was a nice enough walk!\""

The video at the end would not play, so they offered complimentarily tea to the people in our group. Ok, technical problems happen. My daughter was actually excited to have tea. But the tour leader gave out a bunch of paper cups to adults in the group and told several families in the group with small children to get in the line at the counter at the tea room behind paying customers who (understandably) were taking their time. It would have taken us half an hour to get to the tea. I asked the group leader to just get us some cups but she told me that she wasn't allowed to go behind the counter - I am not sure what was stopping her from asking the lady behind the counter to just pass her some cups. Obviously, they just decided to cut their losses. I asked to speak to the manager but he showed no understanding or sympathy - his response was \"what, you want me to get you a cup\".

As you enter the room, a lady dressed in that era greeted us and handed us cards-showing what character we were assigned. We were also handed feathers symbolizing the disguise made so they won't be recognized if caught. You get to keep the cards and feathers at the end of the tour. We were supposed to relive a town hall meeting regarding taxation without representation -and went aboard a replica of the ship where the tea were kept.

Next, you stand or sit under a canopy for 15 min while the actor answers questions. Next you see two wives perspectives but they basically say the same thing as room one. Next you see the tea cheat and talking paintings of King George and Samuel Adams that explain the events once again. Last is a movie about the Revolutionary War.

Just know that it is a highly restrictive tour, where they force you to wait in rooms and listen to cheesy narratives for over an hour and a half.

We were very rushed though and my visitors (one of them didnâ€™t speak English) wanted to take *lots* of pictures and so we didnâ€™t get an opportunity to spend enough time on top of the ship. The tour is timed so after going below, we had to rush off to the next area (indoors) for a re-enactment of more of the history. We were locked in there and then after you have to go to the next area. The next 2 areas are a short film and a room with a cool talking display between historical figures, again you are locked in those rooms. For visitors who donâ€™t speak English, itâ€™s tough. They fell asleep because of their severe jet lag. I guess I should have done more research. I also wouldnâ€™t bring younger children. So all in all, the guides are excellent actors and it is a cool experience, but I donâ€™t think I would do this again unless my kids had a history project or they were old enough to sit still for a while and appreciate the rich history and sacrifice/bravery of the colonists.</td>\n",

Unfortunately on the day of my visit the fire alarm sounded and everyone was taken off the ship to the museum. There followed a holographic presentation outlining a conversation between a loyalist and â€œrevolutionaryâ€ then a short movie describing Paul Reveres ride and the events leading up to and ultimately culminating in the battles at Lexington and Concord. At no point was there any attempt to re-board the ship to finish that part of the tour. In lieu of that everyone was offered a free cup of tea in the tea room upstairs.

My seat was in the bleacher section and center field. Interesting seat if you donâ€™t care about seeing what is going on in the infield. These seats must be great for catching home run balls. My biggest complaint is about the other fans in attendance. I spent more time getting up and down to let folks pass than I have done in attending several seasons of games. I began to question whether folks attended the game to watch or to go for food and bathroom breaks. It was horrible. If they wanted to see their beloved Socks, then they need to stay seated for more than one inning. Guess it was good for Boston cause the team won the game after a period of rough losses.</td>\n",

Everything took a long time, getting everyone through security, corralling everyone through small areas like cattle, getting to talking points, and waiting for the long lines of people behind us to catch up. Just overall a bad experience. On top of the huge crowd, the 1 tour guide for the 100 people seemed very unenthusiastic (honestly I would be too if I had to tour around 100 people in crappy weather) and his body language definitely seemed like this was the last thing he wanted to do. The tour itself was very basic. Light history, not really any behind the scenes besides visitor locker room, media boxes, green monster.

I paid $25 for my ticket, and after the transaction was over, I found a tiny sign in the hall that said the museum would be closing at 4pm that evening for a private event, which left us with less than two hours to view the art. After waiting in line to check our coats, we had about 90 minutes. The museum is confusing and difficult to navigate. The exhibits are not labeled nor are they easily located. Some pieces of art don't even have a sign describing the pieces. Most of the rooms are cavernous but nearly empty- the canvases are scattered out along the walls in no real comprehensive order, and the small placards on the walls offer little to no insight of the pieces you see. Our struggling to navigate the museum was hindered even more by the \"private event\" they were planning. All around us, associates carried tables, tablecloths, steamers, chairs, and cables, without any mind to the paying guests all around them. Honestly, my piece of advice for this establishment would be to simply close for the entire day when an event is to be hosted there. Your staff makes no effort to accommodate your guests or help them find their way- they are too focused on nonsense like making 132 inch tablecloths fit on a 40 inch round table. (Whose idea was that anyway??) About 60 minutes into my visit, after several frustrating attempts navigate the map I found on the wall, I finally found myself in the contemporary art section of the museum and had just begun to observe a large display when a security guard approached me and tapped his watch and ushered me out the door, muttering \"The museum's closing...\" I'll admit, I did hear a voice over the PA system a few minutes prior, but the sound was so distorted, I couldn't understand what the voice was trying to say, and to be honest, I assumed they were speaking another language! When we were shooed out of the contemporary art exhibit, we made our way back to the coat room, collected our things, and fought our way through the crowd back to the front of the building. Once there, I had to navigate the crowd and find a place to put my coat on- being 30 degrees outside, I certainly wasn't fond of the idea of walking out in a sleeveless dress! No sooner had I set my phone and clutch on a table when another elderly security guard approached me and said, \"They're using this table for the party.\" I replied, \"I understand. I am on my way out the door right now,\" while I tried to zip up my coat. He said again, \"This table is for the party. Someone you're with is going to have to hold this for you,\" and he made me STOP zipping my coat to pick up my phone and purse and hand them to my friend so that I could carry on trying to hurry out of his way. Truly, this experience was a frustrating and disappointing endeavor. I feel sick that I wasted money trying to fight my way in to see a few paintings. The entire time I was in the building, I felt like I was an unwanted nuisance.</td>\n",

The minute things go off script, the staff seems lost. The video at the end would not play, so they offered complimentarily tea to the people in our group. Ok, technical problems happen. My daughter was actually excited to have tea. But the tour leader gave out a bunch of paper cups to adults in the group and told several families in the group with small children to get in the line at the counter at the tea room behind paying customers who (understandably) were taking their time. It would have taken us half an hour to get to the tea. I asked the group leader to just get us some cups but she told me that she wasn't allowed to go behind the counter - I am not sure what was stopping her from asking the lady behind the counter to just pass her some cups. Obviously, they just decided to cut their losses. I asked to speak to the manager but he showed no understanding or sympathy - his response was \"what, you want me to get you a cup\". Customer service seems like a foreign concept - for the prices they charged, they really needed to do better.   \n",

Historic Tours of America, Inc. an entertainment company. They charge $29 to go inside. You are first treated to two actors who yell out a script about the \"origins\" of the American split with the British (I guess for those who never got past the second grade), then you are whisked to a ship look alike and herded through the place. You can hurl fake tea bundles into the bay (although they tell you this was not done - they had to open the bundles to pour out the tea, go figure). Next you are quickly escorted into a dark room where holograph figures yell at you. Next you are marched into a room where they show you the one artifact in this \"museum\": as actual crate from the Tea Party. You then hear two paintings yell and argue. The next room has a film (stand) about the first shot of the American Revolution before being forced upstair to the gift shop and overpriced tea room.

I thought we were done after going on the boat, but turns out there are 3-4 rooms where u have to stand for around 15 minutes. Don't waste your money.   \n",

It is on the left side of the Children's museum and close to the area for the tour to MIT. We get a discount from purchasing the trolley tour so we decided to might as well tour the museum. As you enter the room, a lady dressed in that era greeted us and handed us cards-showing what character we were assigned. We were also handed feathers symbolizing the disguise made so they won't be recognized if caught. You get to keep the cards and feathers at the end of the tour. We were supposed to relive a town hall meeting regarding taxation without representation -and went aboard a replica of the ship where the tea were kept. Got a sort of reenactment of how the tea were dumped in the ocean. Video clips were also shown in the museum. The tour guide was in character throughout the tour. Overall an okay tour if you want a piece of history.   \n",

In room one they assign you a person who participated in the tea party and they explain the events leading up to it. This part was good but drawn out. They then take you on the ship which was very boring. Not much to see. Kids threw tea over but weren't overly impressed by this. Kinda lame actually. Next, you stand or sit under a canopy for 15 min while the actor answers questions. Next you see two wives perspectives but they basically say the same thing as room one. Next you see the tea cheat and talking paintings of King George and Samuel Adams that explain the events once again. Last is a movie about the Revolutionary War. It was very educational but the waiting and standing around ruined it especially on a very hot day. I did not like the fact that they don't do reservations like they do in Washington DC. You get assigned a time that is 30 plus min after you buy the tickets so more waiting. Wall to wall people on this crowded day and lots of people cutting the line and walking up to the ticket counter on the other side of the line while the man in charge of the line chats with guests. Overall, it is educational, somewhat interactive but way too long and too pricey for what you really get.   \n",

The only authentic piece in this entire spectacle is one crate of tea from the actual event, everything else is as genuine as Pamela Andersen's face. It is definitely aimed for children and it does a great job engaging and entertaining them. Just know that it is a highly restrictive tour, where they force you to wait in rooms and listen to cheesy narratives for over an hour and a half. We were hoping it would be a quick stop, and I really wish they had a \"non bells and whistles tour.\" Some upsides included how upbeat the staff/actors were- they were really good about creating excitement over something very underwhelming. It was also fun to be able to \"dump\" crates of tea into the harbor. It was also cool to see a real crate from the event, I just wish we weren't forced to sit through the rest of the baloney and could just go on the ships. Overall, come with your kids, otherwise be ready for a lot of hooplah over nothing.   \n",

The guides try hard to engage everyone but I found the chat all very samey and it got a bit boring. Need more interactive elements and the museum had one item in it, a tea box, not much of a museum really! Trying hard to be like Disney and failing. I love history but this left me cold! Abigail's tea room at the end however is excellent, $5.95 for bottomless mug of tea, five types to try and a souvenir mug to take home. Great Value! Don't do this tour if you are on a budget. Duck tour or USS constitution much better.   \n",

In fairness, we did this visit as a side note to touring a lot of other Boston history sites, so we were not really prepared to pay the ticket prices for the tea party experience. To get the full power, I would come with money to do the Boston tea party experience, eat a few things from Abigail's tea room, and have some money to spend in the gift shop.   \n",

The tea room is OK you have to serve yourself and the scones are really rock cakes. The tea is quite good except the souchong. Staff not very helpful especially the girl at the ticket counter.   \n",

Parts of the show would start when you were not in the room. Hard to hear if you got stuck in the back. I thought the tossing of the tea overboard would have been more fun for the kids but they even thought it was nothing exceptional. The cost is on the high side and it was just okay?   \n",

Glad I did though - the actors are very good and get all involved. The museum is very informative with a couple of good surprises. Nice little tea room and food looked good (we just had a coffee). Personally I think the attraction is a little on the pricey side, but we got a discount by showing our trolley tour tickets. I would recommend especially if youâ€™re from out of town.   \n",

It was fun to pose for pictures on top of the ship with the crates of tea too. We were very rushed though and my visitors (one of them didnâ€™t speak English) wanted to take *lots* of pictures and so we didnâ€™t get an opportunity to spend enough time on top of the ship. The tour is timed so after going below, we had to rush off to the next area (indoors) for a re-enactment of more of the history. We were locked in there and then after you have to go to the next area. The next 2 areas are a short film and a room with a cool talking display between historical figures, again you are locked in those rooms. For visitors who donâ€™t speak English, itâ€™s tough. They fell asleep because of their severe jet lag. I guess I should have done more research. I also wouldnâ€™t bring younger children. So all in all, the guides are excellent actors and it is a cool experience, but I donâ€™t think I would do this again unless my kids had a history project or they were old enough to sit still for a while and appreciate the rich history and sacrifice/bravery of the colonists.   \n",

The tour was choreographed with actors in costume playing the roles of revolutionaries, everyone had to yell and scream their support, very immersive noisy experience and not necessarily what you want if you dont have children and would just prefer a museum tour, very American, unfortunately far too in your face for Europeans, there were French and English on the tour who were forced into the role play of a revolutionary like it or not. Worth doing, but you may need to grit your teeth if you are of a reserved nature and do take earplugs if you are sensitive to noise, pretty childish and basic info, but great if you have kids i guess.   \n",

There is also a tea room that you can go to and get a bite to eat, as well as the souvenir shop with all its wares.   \n",

Staff was very nice and entertaining. The replica of two of the three boats involved in the Boston Tea Party were interesting. Throwing the â€œteaâ€overboard was kind of hokey. The tour leader was knowledgeable, but our tour was cut short by about 45 minutes due to an issue with the technology portion of the tour in the museum. It is too bad that the our tour leader could not have just told us verbally what we we supposed to see in a couple of videos. Instead, our group was sent to the tea room, where we got to sample the five types of tea dumped into the harbor, which was interesting to sample. We were offered an opportunity to come back two hours later, but we declined as we had other plans. We did get a refund once I emailed Trusted Tours.   \n",

The staff are enthusiastic and we learned some interesting facts but it was all too hurried. Felt like we were on a conveyor waiting for the next group to be pushed through behind us. They couldnâ€™t wait to get us out into the attached tea room. Didnâ€™t even have enough time to â€œthrowâ€ tea box into the water. Poor value overall   \n",

My husband and I were the only English (non American) people in the group and felt very ignored by the guy handing out cards, very disappointing. We tried not to.let this taint the rest of our trip. Also the tea room was closed for our visit, when I asked about a discount because of this I was very rudely dismissed. Wouldn't rush to go back :-(   \n",

Visitors are encouraged to participate with cheers and boos, so be prepared. You are taken through key events either by the actors or through high-tech multimedia performances. You get to visit one of 2 ships which were involved in the tea party to experience life in the 1770s. The whole tour lasts just over an hour but it all felt very rushed and highly organised, as visitors are shepherded from one event to the next. There was not enough time to read and digest the displays on the wharf. It was definitely a money-making enterprise with the object being to push tours through to the gift shop and the tea room.   \n",

The program begins with costumed actors outlining the events leading up to the tea party. After this you board the ship and another actor discusses the events as they occurred aboard ship the evening of the tea party. Guests are then invited to throw symbolically overboard some boxes of tea re-enacting the event. You are then led down to the cargo hold where the tea was stored on board during the overseas voyage. Unfortunately on the day of my visit the fire alarm sounded and everyone was taken off the ship to the museum. There followed a holographic presentation outlining a conversation between a loyalist and â€œrevolutionaryâ€ then a short movie describing Paul Reveres ride and the events leading up to and ultimately culminating in the battles at Lexington and Concord. At no point was there any attempt to re-board the ship to finish that part of the tour. In lieu of that everyone was offered a free cup of tea in the tea room upstairs. I think it was an overall good presentation, the actors were knowledgeable and enthusiastic and encouraged participation from the guests. However it was very expensive. It was the most that I paid for any historic site in town.   \n",

There is history at this park, but in my opinion not much else. As another reviewer mentioned, the staff at the park is not friendly, esp the security at entrance. I have been to other parks and esp PNC park and everyone is super friendly from entry to exit. My seat was in the bleacher section and center field. Interesting seat if you donâ€™t care about seeing what is going on in the infield. These seats must be great for catching home run balls. My biggest complaint is about the other fans in attendance. I spent more time getting up and down to let folks pass than I have done in attending several seasons of games. I began to question whether folks attended the game to watch or to go for food and bathroom breaks. It was horrible. If they wanted to see their beloved Socks, then they need to stay seated for more than one inning. Guess it was good for Boston cause the team won the game after a period of rough losses.   \n",

It had good reviews and family members before us said it was worth it. We got to the meeting point which was in the team store. When the tour started there was roughly 100 people. I and others, who I heard, thought this was absurd. Everything took a long time, getting everyone through security, corralling everyone through small areas like cattle, getting to talking points, and waiting for the long lines of people behind us to catch up. Just overall a bad experience. On top of the huge crowd, the 1 tour guide for the 100 people seemed very unenthusiastic (honestly I would be too if I had to tour around 100 people in crappy weather) and his body language definitely seemed like this was the last thing he wanted to do. The tour itself was very basic. Light history, not really any behind the scenes besides visitor locker room, media boxes, green monster. This is a big skip for me if you have limited time in the city. Plenty of other things to do. If you love baseball and baseball history maybe worth a try and hope you get a better tour group.   \n",

There is not option to unsubscribe so you have to email someone there to unsubscribe and it's takes forever to get off their list. So annoying! They layout is confusing even with a map as you can only use certain stairs/elevators to get to different areas. Their collection was ok enough. Definitely not one of my favourites. The way they lay out room scenes was fantastic and among the best I've seen. Their salon layout gallery was great too. I honestly wouldn't bother as the hassle wasn't worth it. I'd visit the Isabella Stewart Gardener instead.   \n",
       "21537  I was in Boston for two days. On the second day, I went with a friend to the museum. We arrived shortly after 2pm. I paid $25 for my ticket, and after the transaction was over, I found a tiny sign in the hall that said the museum would be closing at 4pm that evening for a private event, which left us with less than two hours to view the art. After waiting in line to check our coats, we had about 90 minutes. The museum is confusing and difficult to navigate. The exhibits are not labeled nor are they easily located. Some pieces of art don't even have a sign describing the pieces. Most of the rooms are cavernous but nearly empty- the canvases are scattered out along the walls in no real comprehensive order, and the small placards on the walls offer little to no insight of the pieces you see. Our struggling to navigate the museum was hindered even more by the \"private event\" they were planning. All around us, associates carried tables, tablecloths, steamers, chairs, and cables, without any mind to the paying guests all around them. Honestly, my piece of advice for this establishment would be to simply close for the entire day when an event is to be hosted there. Your staff makes no effort to accommodate your guests or help them find their way- they are too focused on nonsense like making 132 inch tablecloths fit on a 40 inch round table. (Whose idea was that anyway??) About 60 minutes into my visit, after several frustrating attempts navigate the map I found on the wall, I finally found myself in the contemporary art section of the museum and had just begun to observe a large display when a security guard approached me and tapped his watch and ushered me out the door, muttering \"The museum's closing...\" I'll admit, I did hear a voice over the PA system a few minutes prior, but the sound was so distorted, I couldn't understand what the voice was trying to say, and to be honest, I assumed they were speaking another language! When we were shooed out of the contemporary art exhibit, we made our way back to the coat room, collected our things, and fought our way through the crowd back to the front of the building. Once there, I had to navigate the crowd and find a place to put my coat on- being 30 degrees outside, I certainly wasn't fond of the idea of walking out in a sleeveless dress! No sooner had I set my phone and clutch on a table when another elderly security guard approached me and said, \"They're using this table for the party.\" I replied, \"I understand. I am on my way out the door right now,\" while I tried to zip up my coat. He said again, \"This table is for the party. Someone you're with is going to have to hold this for you,\" and he made me STOP zipping my coat to pick up my phone and purse and hand them to my friend so that I could carry on trying to hurry out of his way. Truly, this experience was a frustrating and disappointing endeavor. I feel sick that I wasted money trying to fight my way in to see a few paintings. The entire time I was in the building, I felt like I was an unwanted nuisance.   \n",

      "This is an interesting attraction with a good concept, but this is where the good things stop. The minute things go off script, the staff seems lost. The video at the end would not play, so they offered complimentarily tea to the people in our group. Ok, technical problems happen. My daughter was actually excited to have tea. But the tour leader gave out a bunch of paper cups to adults in the group and told several families in the group with small children to get in the line at the counter at the tea room behind paying customers who (understandably) were taking their time. It would have taken us half an hour to get to the tea. I asked the group leader to just get us some cups but she told me that she wasn't allowed to go behind the counter - I am not sure what was stopping her from asking the lady behind the counter to just pass her some cups. Obviously, they just decided to cut their losses. I asked to speak to the manager but he showed no understanding or sympathy - his response was \"what, you want me to get you a cup\". Customer service seems like a foreign concept - for the prices they charged, they really needed to do better.\n",

      "This is run by (for Profit?) Historic Tours of America, Inc. an entertainment company. They charge $29 to go inside. You are first treated to two actors who yell out a script about the \"origins\" of the American split with the British (I guess for those who never got past the second grade), then you are whisked to a ship look alike and herded through the place. You can hurl fake tea bundles into the bay (although they tell you this was not done - they had to open the bundles to pour out the tea, go figure). Next you are quickly escorted into a dark room where holograph figures yell at you. Next you are marched into a room where they show you the one artifact in this \"museum\": as actual crate from the Tea Party. You then hear two paintings yell and argue. The next room has a film (stand) about the first shot of the American Revolution before being forced upstair to the gift shop and overpriced tea room. Total Time 30 minutes (not counting the time in the gift shop)\n",

      "We bought a hop on hop off old town trolley tour and we decided to get off on the stop in front of the Museum. It is on the left side of the Children's museum and close to the area for the tour to MIT. We get a discount from purchasing the trolley tour so we decided to might as well tour the museum. As you enter the room, a lady dressed in that era greeted us and handed us cards-showing what character we were assigned. We were also handed feathers symbolizing the disguise made so they won't be recognized if caught. You get to keep the cards and feathers at the end of the tour. We were supposed to relive a town hall meeting regarding taxation without representation -and went aboard a replica of the ship where the tea were kept. Got a sort of reenactment of how the tea were dumped in the ocean. Video clips were also shown in the museum. The tour guide was in character throughout the tour. Overall an okay tour if you want a piece of history.\n",

      "The actors were good but there was way too much sitting and standing around in between the places they take you. In room one they assign you a person who participated in the tea party and they explain the events leading up to it. This part was good but drawn out. They then take you on the ship which was very boring. Not much to see. Kids threw tea over but weren't overly impressed by this. Kinda lame actually. Next, you stand or sit under a canopy for 15 min while the actor answers questions. Next you see two wives perspectives but they basically say the same thing as room one. Next you see the tea cheat and talking paintings of King George and Samuel Adams that explain the events once again. Last is a movie about the Revolutionary War. It was very educational but the waiting and standing around ruined it especially on a very hot day. I did not like the fact that they don't do reservations like they do in Washington DC. You get assigned a time that is 30 plus min after you buy the tickets so more waiting. Wall to wall people on this crowded day and lots of people cutting the line and walking up to the ticket counter on the other side of the line while the man in charge of the line chats with guests. Overall, it is educational, somewhat interactive but way too long and too pricey for what you really get.\n",

      "This attraction felt more like a theme park than a historical site. The only authentic piece in this entire spectacle is one crate of tea from the actual event, everything else is as genuine as Pamela Andersen's face. It is definitely aimed for children and it does a great job engaging and entertaining them. Just know that it is a highly restrictive tour, where they force you to wait in rooms and listen to cheesy narratives for over an hour and a half. We were hoping it would be a quick stop, and I really wish they had a \"non bells and whistles tour.\" Some upsides included how upbeat the staff/actors were- they were really good about creating excitement over something very underwhelming. It was also fun to be able to \"dump\" crates of tea into the harbor. It was also cool to see a real crate from the event, I just wish we weren't forced to sit through the rest of the baloney and could just go on the ships. Overall, come with your kids, otherwise be ready for a lot of hooplah over nothing.\n",

      "This could be so much better! The guides try hard to engage everyone but I found the chat all very samey and it got a bit boring. Need more interactive elements and the museum had one item in it, a tea box, not much of a museum really! Trying hard to be like Disney and failing. I love history but this left me cold! Abigail's tea room at the end however is excellent, $5.95 for bottomless mug of tea, five types to try and a souvenir mug to take home. Great Value! Don't do this tour if you are on a budget. Duck tour or USS constitution much better.\n",

      "The experiencing of being in the harbor where such a significant event in history took place was awesome, the rest of it, not so much. In fairness, we did this visit as a side note to touring a lot of other Boston history sites, so we were not really prepared to pay the ticket prices for the tea party experience. To get the full power, I would come with money to do the Boston tea party experience, eat a few things from Abigail's tea room, and have some money to spend in the gift shop.\n",

The museum is very informative with a couple of good surprises. Nice little tea room and food looked good (we just had a coffee). Personally I think the attraction is a little on the pricey side, but we got a discount by showing our trolley tour tickets. I would recommend especially if youâ€™re from out of town.\n",

      "This museum was unique and very informative about the rich history of the event known as the Boston Tea Party. It was fun to pose for pictures on top of the ship with the crates of tea too. We were very rushed though and my visitors (one of them didnâ€™t speak English) wanted to take *lots* of pictures and so we didnâ€™t get an opportunity to spend enough time on top of the ship. The tour is timed so after going below, we had to rush off to the next area (indoors) for a re-enactment of more of the history. We were locked in there and then after you have to go to the next area. The next 2 areas are a short film and a room with a cool talking display between historical figures, again you are locked in those rooms. For visitors who donâ€™t speak English, itâ€™s tough. They fell asleep because of their severe jet lag. I guess I should have done more research. I also wouldnâ€™t bring younger children. So all in all, the guides are excellent actors and it is a cool experience, but I donâ€™t think I would do this again unless my kids had a history project or they were old enough to sit still for a while and appreciate the rich history and sacrifice/bravery of the colonists.\n",

      "Abigails tearoom was best bit, they had tea tasting so just ask for an empty cup and then try upto 5 teas in a room overlooking harbour with soothing classical music, almost felt European. The tour was choreographed with actors in costume playing the roles of revolutionaries, everyone had to yell and scream their support, very immersive noisy experience and not necessarily what you want if you dont have children and would just prefer a museum tour, very American, unfortunately far too in your face for Europeans, there were French and English on the tour who were forced into the role play of a revolutionary like it or not. Worth doing, but you may need to grit your teeth if you are of a reserved nature and do take earplugs if you are sensitive to noise, pretty childish and basic info, but great if you have kids i guess.\n",

      "We did this excursion on 7/31. Staff was very nice and entertaining. The replica of two of the three boats involved in the Boston Tea Party were interesting. Throwing the â€œteaâ€overboard was kind of hokey. The tour leader was knowledgeable, but our tour was cut short by about 45 minutes due to an issue with the technology portion of the tour in the museum. It is too bad that the our tour leader could not have just told us verbally what we we supposed to see in a couple of videos. Instead, our group was sent to the tea room, where we got to sample the five types of tea dumped into the harbor, which was interesting to sample. We were offered an opportunity to come back two hours later, but we declined as we had other plans. We did get a refund once I emailed Trusted Tours.\n",

      "This tour, led by actors in period costume, re-enacts events leading up to, and after the Boston tea party. Visitors are encouraged to participate with cheers and boos, so be prepared. You are taken through key events either by the actors or through high-tech multimedia performances. You get to visit one of 2 ships which were involved in the tea party to experience life in the 1770s. The whole tour lasts just over an hour but it all felt very rushed and highly organised, as visitors are shepherded from one event to the next. There was not enough time to read and digest the displays on the wharf. It was definitely a money-making enterprise with the object being to push tours through to the gift shop and the tea room.\n",

      "At $25 with a AAA discount this site is not cheap. The program begins with costumed actors outlining the events leading up to the tea party. After this you board the ship and another actor discusses the events as they occurred aboard ship the evening of the tea party. Guests are then invited to throw symbolically overboard some boxes of tea re-enacting the event. You are then led down to the cargo hold where the tea was stored on board during the overseas voyage. Unfortunately on the day of my visit the fire alarm sounded and everyone was taken off the ship to the museum. There followed a holographic presentation outlining a conversation between a loyalist and â€œrevolutionaryâ€ then a short movie describing Paul Reveres ride and the events leading up to and ultimately culminating in the battles at Lexington and Concord. At no point was there any attempt to re-board the ship to finish that part of the tour. In lieu of that everyone was offered a free cup of tea in the tea room upstairs. I think it was an overall good presentation, the actors were knowledgeable and enthusiastic and encouraged participation from the guests. However it was very expensive. It was the most that I paid for any historic site in town.\n",

As another reviewer mentioned, the staff at the park is not friendly, esp the security at entrance. I have been to other parks and esp PNC park and everyone is super friendly from entry to exit. My seat was in the bleacher section and center field. Interesting seat if you donâ€™t care about seeing what is going on in the infield. These seats must be great for catching home run balls. My biggest complaint is about the other fans in attendance. I spent more time getting up and down to let folks pass than I have done in attending several seasons of games. I began to question whether folks attended the game to watch or to go for food and bathroom breaks. It was horrible. If they wanted to see their beloved Socks, then they need to stay seated for more than one inning. Guess it was good for Boston cause the team won the game after a period of rough losses.\n",

      "This was the first tour we did after arriving into Boston. It had good reviews and family members before us said it was worth it. We got to the meeting point which was in the team store. When the tour started there was roughly 100 people. I and others, who I heard, thought this was absurd. Everything took a long time, getting everyone through security, corralling everyone through small areas like cattle, getting to talking points, and waiting for the long lines of people behind us to catch up. Just overall a bad experience. On top of the huge crowd, the 1 tour guide for the 100 people seemed very unenthusiastic (honestly I would be too if I had to tour around 100 people in crappy weather) and his body language definitely seemed like this was the last thing he wanted to do. The tour itself was very basic. Light history, not really any behind the scenes besides visitor locker room, media boxes, green monster. This is a big skip for me if you have limited time in the city. Plenty of other things to do. If you love baseball and baseball history maybe worth a try and hope you get a better tour group.\n",

There is not option to unsubscribe so you have to email someone there to unsubscribe and it's takes forever to get off their list. So annoying! They layout is confusing even with a map as you can only use certain stairs/elevators to get to different areas. Their collection was ok enough. Definitely not one of my favourites. The way they lay out room scenes was fantastic and among the best I've seen. Their salon layout gallery was great too. I honestly wouldn't bother as the hassle wasn't worth it.

      "I was in Boston for two days. On the second day, I went with a friend to the museum. We arrived shortly after 2pm. I paid $25 for my ticket, and after the transaction was over, I found a tiny sign in the hall that said the museum would be closing at 4pm that evening for a private event, which left us with less than two hours to view the art. After waiting in line to check our coats, we had about 90 minutes. The museum is confusing and difficult to navigate. The exhibits are not labeled nor are they easily located. Some pieces of art don't even have a sign describing the pieces. Most of the rooms are cavernous but nearly empty- the canvases are scattered out along the walls in no real comprehensive order, and the small placards on the walls offer little to no insight of the pieces you see. Our struggling to navigate the museum was hindered even more by the \"private event\" they were planning. All around us, associates carried tables, tablecloths, steamers, chairs, and cables, without any mind to the paying guests all around them. Honestly, my piece of advice for this establishment would be to simply close for the entire day when an event is to be hosted there. Your staff makes no effort to accommodate your guests or help them find their way- they are too focused on nonsense like making 132 inch tablecloths fit on a 40 inch round table. (Whose idea was that anyway??) About 60 minutes into my visit, after several frustrating attempts navigate the map I found on the wall, I finally found myself in the contemporary art section of the museum and had just begun to observe a large display when a security guard approached me and tapped his watch and ushered me out the door, muttering \"The museum's closing...\" I'll admit, I did hear a voice over the PA system a few minutes prior, but the sound was so distorted, I couldn't understand what the voice was trying to say, and to be honest, I assumed they were speaking another language! When we were shooed out of the contemporary art exhibit, we made our way back to the coat room, collected our things, and fought our way through the crowd back to the front of the building. Once there, I had to navigate the crowd and find a place to put my coat on- being 30 degrees outside, I certainly wasn't fond of the idea of walking out in a sleeveless dress! No sooner had I set my phone and clutch on a table when another elderly security guard approached me and said, \"They're using this table for the party.\" I replied, \"I understand. I am on my way out the door right now,\" while I tried to zip up my coat. He said again, \"This table is for the party. Someone you're with is going to have to hold this for you,\" and he made me STOP zipping my coat to pick up my phone and purse and hand them to my friend so that I could carry on trying to hurry out of his way. Truly, this experience was a frustrating and disappointing endeavor. I feel sick that I wasted money trying to fight my way in to see a few paintings. The entire time I was in the building, I felt like I was an unwanted nuisance.\n",

       "      <td>This is run by (for Profit?) Historic Tours of America, Inc. an entertainment company. They charge $29 to go inside. You are first treated to two actors who yell out a script about the \"origins\" of the American split with the British (I guess for those who never got past the second grade), then you are whisked to a ship look alike and herded through the place. You can hurl fake tea bundles into the bay (although they tell you this was not done - they had to open the bundles to pour out the tea, go figure). Next you are quickly escorted into a dark room where holograph figures yell at you. Next you are marched into a room where they show you the one artifact in this \"museum\": as actual crate from the Tea Party. You then hear two paintings yell and argue. The next room has a film (stand) about the first shot of the American Revolution before being forced upstair to the gift shop and overpriced tea room. Total Time 30 minutes (not counting the time in the gift shop)</td>\n",

       "      <td>I was in Boston for two days. On the second day, I went with a friend to the museum. We arrived shortly after 2pm. I paid $25 for my ticket, and after the transaction was over, I found a tiny sign in the hall that said the museum would be closing at 4pm that evening for a private event, which left us with less than two hours to view the art. After waiting in line to check our coats, we had about 90 minutes. The museum is confusing and difficult to navigate. The exhibits are not labeled nor are they easily located. Some pieces of art don't even have a sign describing the pieces. Most of the rooms are cavernous but nearly empty- the canvases are scattered out along the walls in no real comprehensive order, and the small placards on the walls offer little to no insight of the pieces you see. Our struggling to navigate the museum was hindered even more by the \"private event\" they were planning. All around us, associates carried tables, tablecloths, steamers, chairs, and cables, without any mind to the paying guests all around them. Honestly, my piece of advice for this establishment would be to simply close for the entire day when an event is to be hosted there. Your staff makes no effort to accommodate your guests or help them find their way- they are too focused on nonsense like making 132 inch tablecloths fit on a 40 inch round table. (Whose idea was that anyway??) About 60 minutes into my visit, after several frustrating attempts navigate the map I found on the wall, I finally found myself in the contemporary art section of the museum and had just begun to observe a large display when a security guard approached me and tapped his watch and ushered me out the door, muttering \"The museum's closing...\" I'll admit, I did hear a voice over the PA system a few minutes prior, but the sound was so distorted, I couldn't understand what the voice was trying to say, and to be honest, I assumed they were speaking another language! When we were shooed out of the contemporary art exhibit, we made our way back to the coat room, collected our things, and fought our way through the crowd back to the front of the building. Once there, I had to navigate the crowd and find a place to put my coat on- being 30 degrees outside, I certainly wasn't fond of the idea of walking out in a sleeveless dress! No sooner had I set my phone and clutch on a table when another elderly security guard approached me and said, \"They're using this table for the party.\" I replied, \"I understand. I am on my way out the door right now,\" while I tried to zip up my coat. He said again, \"This table is for the party. Someone you're with is going to have to hold this for you,\" and he made me STOP zipping my coat to pick up my phone and purse and hand them to my friend so that I could carry on trying to hurry out of his way. Truly, this experience was a frustrating and disappointing endeavor. I feel sick that I wasted money trying to fight my way in to see a few paintings. The entire time I was in the building, I felt like I was an unwanted nuisance.</td>\n",

Historic Tours of America, Inc. an entertainment company. They charge $29 to go inside. You are first treated to two actors who yell out a script about the \"origins\" of the American split with the British (I guess for those who never got past the second grade), then you are whisked to a ship look alike and herded through the place. You can hurl fake tea bundles into the bay (although they tell you this was not done - they had to open the bundles to pour out the tea, go figure). Next you are quickly escorted into a dark room where holograph figures yell at you. Next you are marched into a room where they show you the one artifact in this \"museum\": as actual crate from the Tea Party. You then hear two paintings yell and argue. The next room has a film (stand) about the first shot of the American Revolution before being forced upstair to the gift shop and overpriced tea room. Total Time 30 minutes (not counting the time in the gift shop)  \n",
       "21537  I was in Boston for two days. On the second day, I went with a friend to the museum. We arrived shortly after 2pm. I paid $25 for my ticket, and after the transaction was over, I found a tiny sign in the hall that said the museum would be closing at 4pm that evening for a private event, which left us with less than two hours to view the art. After waiting in line to check our coats, we had about 90 minutes. The museum is confusing and difficult to navigate. The exhibits are not labeled nor are they easily located. Some pieces of art don't even have a sign describing the pieces. Most of the rooms are cavernous but nearly empty- the canvases are scattered out along the walls in no real comprehensive order, and the small placards on the walls offer little to no insight of the pieces you see. Our struggling to navigate the museum was hindered even more by the \"private event\" they were planning. All around us, associates carried tables, tablecloths, steamers, chairs, and cables, without any mind to the paying guests all around them. Honestly, my piece of advice for this establishment would be to simply close for the entire day when an event is to be hosted there. Your staff makes no effort to accommodate your guests or help them find their way- they are too focused on nonsense like making 132 inch tablecloths fit on a 40 inch round table. (Whose idea was that anyway??) About 60 minutes into my visit, after several frustrating attempts navigate the map I found on the wall, I finally found myself in the contemporary art section of the museum and had just begun to observe a large display when a security guard approached me and tapped his watch and ushered me out the door, muttering \"The museum's closing...\" I'll admit, I did hear a voice over the PA system a few minutes prior, but the sound was so distorted, I couldn't understand what the voice was trying to say, and to be honest, I assumed they were speaking another language! When we were shooed out of the contemporary art exhibit, we made our way back to the coat room, collected our things, and fought our way through the crowd back to the front of the building. Once there, I had to navigate the crowd and find a place to put my coat on- being 30 degrees outside, I certainly wasn't fond of the idea of walking out in a sleeveless dress! No sooner had I set my phone and clutch on a table when another elderly security guard approached me and said, \"They're using this table for the party.\" I replied, \"I understand. I am on my way out the door right now,\" while I tried to zip up my coat. He said again, \"This table is for the party. Someone you're with is going to have to hold this for you,\" and he made me STOP zipping my coat to pick up my phone and purse and hand them to my friend so that I could carry on trying to hurry out of his way. Truly, this experience was a frustrating and disappointing endeavor. I feel sick that I wasted money trying to fight my way in to see a few paintings. The entire time I was in the building, I felt like I was an unwanted nuisance.  \n",

My husband and I were the only English (non American) people in the group and felt very ignored by the guy handing out cards, very disappointing. We tried not to.let this taint the rest of our trip. Also the tea room was closed for our visit, when I asked about a discount because of this I was very rudely dismissed. Wouldn't rush to go back :-(  "

In room one they assign you a person who participated in the tea party and they explain the events leading up to it. This part was good but drawn out. They then take you on the ship which was very boring. Not much to see. Kids threw tea over but weren't overly impressed by this. Kinda lame actually. Next, you stand or sit under a canopy for 15 min while the actor answers questions. Next you see two wives perspectives but they basically say the same thing as room one. Next you see the tea cheat and talking paintings of King George and Samuel Adams that explain the events once again. Last is a movie about the Revolutionary War. It was very educational but the waiting and standing around ruined it especially on a very hot day. I did not like the fact that they don't do reservations like they do in Washington DC. You get assigned a time that is 30 plus min after you buy the tickets so more waiting. Wall to wall people on this crowded day and lots of people cutting the line and walking up to the ticket counter on the other side of the line while the man in charge of the line chats with guests. Overall, it is educational, somewhat interactive but way too long and too pricey for what you really get.</td>\n",

I believe they paid to go onboard to tour the real looking ship and participate in the revolution. The staff were dressed in historically appropriate attire and kids would probably really get a kick out of doing this. We checked out the gift shop too, but overall it just wasn't my 'cup of tea'. We did walk close by to a waterfront seafood restaurant that was great but when the rain picked up it was a chilly (yummy) meal under their tent.</td>\n",

So much for tradition. Now, as far as the tour, it was fairly unimpressive. This was more like a \"pick your seat\" day. All you did was walk around the seats and look at the stadium/field from different vantage points. That's great and should be part of the tour, but it left us wanting more. You don't get to see anything you couldn't see by just buying a game ticket. Didn't get on the field or in the dugouts, dressing rooms, broadcast booths, suites, underneath inner workings. Nothing but walk around in the stands. You will get a little bit of history about the Red Sox and the Stadium from the tour guide, but still left wanting more.

The buffet had a number of interesting choices, but only a couple really hit it out of the park. The onion rings were over cooked, the carving station beef was flavorless and the hush puppies were more like marbles.

I would have liked to learn about Fenway's construction....Who were the workers who built it? What did it cost to construct? What VIPS attended games? How about a tour of the Dug Out and Locker Room when the team is on the Road. There was a fund raiser on the field the day I went. Better to close the tour and let us tourists walk the warming track, See the Bull Pen, Hear from the score keepers who post the runs, strikes and outs from inside the Score Board. Although elevators exist which I needed to get around the stadium I was ushered around the building separately from the tour guide and group as a whole. I appreciated the consideration however a knowledgeable alternate tour guide would have been desirable, Overall, my experience was a 6.5 on scale of 10 for want of some the missing elements I mention above and the possibility of missing more of what the tour guide had to say after being ushered away from the group.

The way the park is set up with the support beams and angles of the seats there are many obstructed views of the field. We could see nothing from left center field to the foul pole due to the angle of our seating and the construction of the left field seating wall. The constant flow of vendors carrying wares in front of us obstructed our view as well due the slight slope of the seating to the field level. I Love Boston and The Sox but will probably not go back to Fenway again and will definitely not sit anywhere on 3rd Base side. The Fans were Awesome! We had a great time before the game walking the park and visiting with people in and around the Park. If you want a Beer or Drink bring your ID. We are in our 60â€™s and could not buy a cold one having no idea of this restriction.

I paid $25 for my ticket, and after the transaction was over, I found a tiny sign in the hall that said the museum would be closing at 4pm that evening for a private event, which left us with less than two hours to view the art. After waiting in line to check our coats, we had about 90 minutes. The museum is confusing and difficult to navigate. The exhibits are not labeled nor are they easily located. Some pieces of art don't even have a sign describing the pieces. Most of the rooms are cavernous but nearly empty- the canvases are scattered out along the walls in no real comprehensive order, and the small placards on the walls offer little to no insight of the pieces you see. Our struggling to navigate the museum was hindered even more by the \"private event\" they were planning. All around us, associates carried tables, tablecloths, steamers, chairs, and cables, without any mind to the paying guests all around them. Honestly, my piece of advice for this establishment would be to simply close for the entire day when an event is to be hosted there. Your staff makes no effort to accommodate your guests or help them find their way- they are too focused on nonsense like making 132 inch tablecloths fit on a 40 inch round table. (Whose idea was that anyway??) About 60 minutes into my visit, after several frustrating attempts navigate the map I found on the wall, I finally found myself in the contemporary art section of the museum and had just begun to observe a large display when a security guard approached me and tapped his watch and ushered me out the door, muttering \"The museum's closing...\" I'll admit, I did hear a voice over the PA system a few minutes prior, but the sound was so distorted, I couldn't understand what the voice was trying to say, and to be honest, I assumed they were speaking another language! When we were shooed out of the contemporary art exhibit, we made our way back to the coat room, collected our things, and fought our way through the crowd back to the front of the building. Once there, I had to navigate the crowd and find a place to put my coat on- being 30 degrees outside, I certainly wasn't fond of the idea of walking out in a sleeveless dress! No sooner had I set my phone and clutch on a table when another elderly security guard approached me and said, \"They're using this table for the party.\" I replied, \"I understand. I am on my way out the door right now,\" while I tried to zip up my coat. He said again, \"This table is for the party. Someone you're with is going to have to hold this for you,\" and he made me STOP zipping my coat to pick up my phone and purse and hand them to my friend so that I could carry on trying to hurry out of his way. Truly, this experience was a frustrating and disappointing endeavor. I feel sick that I wasted money trying to fight my way in to see a few paintings. The entire time I was in the building, I felt like I was an unwanted nuisance.</td>\n",

We might have asked a guard before standing in line, but the Huntington Avenue entrance is a bottleneck: visitors enter and stand around getting oriented, making everything confused. From the ticket counter, there's a sign pointing to the coat check, but from there we got to the pick-up only part of coat check and had to walk around the galleries to find the drop-off. Looking for the Pastels exhibition, we found a sign pointing to it, then nothing; in the end we spotted the sign over the exhibition entrance, far in the distance. For Pooh, we went to the gallery entrance at our appointed time, but were told to go to another space to queue, and then had to wait beyond our appointed time to allow earlier visitors to pass further into the show, something that didn't work very well and was a further confusion.</td>\n",

Not only was it disappointing that the galleries were closed, but it also meant, that as someone who has mobility problems, I found it difficult to find a lift that I could use that did not end up in a dead end. There were some exhibits closed that I really wanted to see. The other disappointment was the very large number of school parties that were visiting. This meant that moving around the museum was challenging because being young people they were not aware of anything outside their world, including people trying to get through the corridors that they were spread across. The museum acoustics were also quite poor, so the children shrieking at each other was amplified. There seemed to be no attempts to keep their voices down a little so as not to interrupt the enjoyment of other visitors. It was a Friday in February, and maybe this is a day to avoid.

My family and friends walked all around the North End looking at all the buildings, brownstones, shops and some of the historic sites. They had a few artsy areas that were pretty cool. This place is spotless which is surprisingly great considering this is a city. Parking is not available so you'll need to pay to park in a garage. There is plenty of restaurants around as well. I felt this was ok. I'm glad I did this just really nothing great. Very similar to NYC.</td>\n",

It's definitely worth a walk around there, but if someone asked me if that's a must see of Boston, unless I knew they were very interested in seeing Paul Revere's house, the Old North Church or follow the Freedom Trail, I'd suggest to first do other things.

In room one they assign you a person who participated in the tea party and they explain the events leading up to it. This part was good but drawn out. They then take you on the ship which was very boring. Not much to see. Kids threw tea over but weren't overly impressed by this. Kinda lame actually. Next, you stand or sit under a canopy for 15 min while the actor answers questions. Next you see two wives perspectives but they basically say the same thing as room one. Next you see the tea cheat and talking paintings of King George and Samuel Adams that explain the events once again. Last is a movie about the Revolutionary War. It was very educational but the waiting and standing around ruined it especially on a very hot day. I did not like the fact that they don't do reservations like they do in Washington DC. You get assigned a time that is 30 plus min after you buy the tickets so more waiting. Wall to wall people on this crowded day and lots of people cutting the line and walking up to the ticket counter on the other side of the line while the man in charge of the line chats with guests. Overall, it is educational, somewhat interactive but way too long and too pricey for what you really get.   \n",

There were people participating in the tea party, by throwing large square 'bales of tea' overboard. I believe they paid to go onboard to tour the real looking ship and participate in the revolution. The staff were dressed in historically appropriate attire and kids would probably really get a kick out of doing this. We checked out the gift shop too, but overall it just wasn't my 'cup of tea'. We did walk close by to a waterfront seafood restaurant that was great but when the rain picked up it was a chilly (yummy) meal under their tent.   \n",

It's a nice small exhibition, mostly played by actors and contains visual effects. Not a regular museum you are expected to see. As for my boy it was boring especially if English isn't your language. So it looks like more as a small show on very low level. Don't waste your time and money, just take a walk around .   \n",

It's not a museum. There are a town hall re-enactment by the staff followed, a pretend tea tossing exercise, a quick walk around the boat, then a couple videos. The tea box handed down through generations is plausible, the tea recovered from the boot not so much. The digital picture technology was cool. Not a 'museum' experience.   \n",

It was great to see Fenway for the first time. So much history! I admire the fact that they have maintained the ballpark in the same location since 1912. I live in the Dallas/Fort Worth area and the Rangers are building a new park after only twenty years. So much for tradition. Now, as far as the tour, it was fairly unimpressive. This was more like a \"pick your seat\" day. All you did was walk around the seats and look at the stadium/field from different vantage points. That's great and should be part of the tour, but it left us wanting more. You don't get to see anything you couldn't see by just buying a game ticket. Didn't get on the field or in the dugouts, dressing rooms, broadcast booths, suites, underneath inner workings. Nothing but walk around in the stands. You will get a little bit of history about the Red Sox and the Stadium from the tour guide, but still left wanting more. This is the most historic Stadium in baseball, it should have a tour to match!   \n",

Shouldn't they take care of that before they arrive? Then because the tour was late starting, we were rushed through the museum - the most interesting part of the tour. The rest of the tour was simply walking around the top of the stadium. We didn't see the locker rooms or the press room as we did at the Atlanta Braves stadium.   \n",

The parking was only $18.00, but you have to scan your Red Sox Ticket at the exit gate to get the rate. So don't discard your Red Sox ticket or you'll pay $42.00 to park. The Seats in the State Street Pavilion are the best I've ever had. I've been going to Fenway for nearly 50 years. My wife and I were very excited to have seats in the State Street Pavilion. We made a dinner reservation in the restaurant. When we arrived we waited around thirty minutes for water. Our waitress apologized profusely and was very pleasent. We elected to eat from the buffet becuase of the selection and fear we would wait another long spell for dinner. The buffet was $43.00. The buffet had a number of interesting choices, but only a couple really hit it out of the park. The onion rings were over cooked, the carving station beef was flavorless and the hush puppies were more like marbles. The buffet also closed early so we weren't able to enjoy the meal and sample the items that looked appetizing. Our bill was $118.00 plus the tip. On the upside, the octopus salad, tandori chicken and pork sliders were very good. Next time we'll order of the menu. We could have saved money and enjoyed dinner more.   \n",

There were approximately 70 to 100 people in a herd with a tour guide and microphone. Although Fenway is on the National Register of Historic Places the guide only made mention of this. I would have liked to learn about Fenway's construction....Who were the workers who built it? What did it cost to construct? What VIPS attended games? How about a tour of the Dug Out and Locker Room when the team is on the Road. There was a fund raiser on the field the day I went. Better to close the tour and let us tourists walk the warming track, See the Bull Pen, Hear from the score keepers who post the runs, strikes and outs from inside the Score Board. Although elevators exist which I needed to get around the stadium I was ushered around the building separately from the tour guide and group as a whole. I appreciated the consideration however a knowledgeable alternate tour guide would have been desirable, Overall, my experience was a 6.5 on scale of 10 for want of some the missing elements I mention above and the possibility of missing more of what the tour guide had to say after being ushered away from the group. P.S I am Yankees Fan.   \n",

We were 20 or so rows from the field. The seats had to have been installed in 1916 and were very uncomfortable and cramped. I had to literally take turns with the fan beside me putting my arms down at my side. The way the park is set up with the support beams and angles of the seats there are many obstructed views of the field. We could see nothing from left center field to the foul pole due to the angle of our seating and the construction of the left field seating wall. The constant flow of vendors carrying wares in front of us obstructed our view as well due the slight slope of the seating to the field level. I Love Boston and The Sox but will probably not go back to Fenway again and will definitely not sit anywhere on 3rd Base side. The Fans were Awesome! We had a great time before the game walking the park and visiting with people in and around the Park. If you want a Beer or Drink bring your ID. We are in our 60â€™s and could not buy a cold one having no idea of this restriction. They need a better way to handle this as even the vendors out in the stands carded, which added more obstruction to fans views. Sox Won Big.   \n",

Tour guide was very good, she knew her history and facts well, and could relate to some of the great and not so great times at Fenway, we were led through various grandstands and through the press box. I was tad disappointed we never went near players changing rooms, but overall good hours tour and worth it. I was back later on that day to see Red Sox v LA Dodgers. Well worth trip from Englad to see a famous stadium and the Dodgers,   \n",

The place shows it's age but is O.K. for what it is. You can not explore the whole park with your ticket, every other park I've been to you can walk around the whole park, not Fenway. City around the park is nice with lots of places to eat. Sweet Cheeks BBQ is a great place to get a bite before the game.   \n",

We did get to go up behind the green monster but for the price it would have been nice to see some back areas of the stadium like we have seen at others.   \n",

It excluded going on the field, in the dugout, or into the locker rooms. We basically just walked around the concourse and that was it. Not impressed.   \n",

But there were so many school children of all ages that it made just walking around a difficult experience. Wow, there were thousands of kids everywhere and my guess is that the city sets aside specific days that cater mostly to field trips. I waited a very long time just to use the bathroom. Avoid these days!! Call the city tourist info headquarters well in advance and plan accordingly.   \n",

We did not stay very long at any of the points, had a brief lunch at a walk up stand in Quincy Market, and still took 4+ hours. The down fall was doing the trail on day 3 of our visit to Boston. We arrived in town before our friends and had been around the city sight seeing, so when it came time to do the trail we were essentially seeing the same things all over again. The last few points were new to see and we stopped at Bunker Hill, all of us completely exhausted and felt like our time could have been better spent. We ended up taking an Uber ride back to our hotel because we couldn't stand to do any more walking! Grant it, I'm not a history buff but if you are and intend to do the trail I strongly recommend making this the 1st thing you do while in Boston.   \n",

However during our walking around we did actually see some of the buildings and to see they still exist in a modern city was very rewarding! What I enjoyed was the buildings and their history.   \n",

       "21537  I was in Boston for two days. On the second day, I went with a friend to the museum. We arrived shortly after 2pm. I paid $25 for my ticket, and after the transaction was over, I found a tiny sign in the hall that said the museum would be closing at 4pm that evening for a private event, which left us with less than two hours to view the art. After waiting in line to check our coats, we had about 90 minutes. The museum is confusing and difficult to navigate. The exhibits are not labeled nor are they easily located. Some pieces of art don't even have a sign describing the pieces. Most of the rooms are cavernous but nearly empty- the canvases are scattered out along the walls in no real comprehensive order, and the small placards on the walls offer little to no insight of the pieces you see. Our struggling to navigate the museum was hindered even more by the \"private event\" they were planning. All around us, associates carried tables, tablecloths, steamers, chairs, and cables, without any mind to the paying guests all around them. Honestly, my piece of advice for this establishment would be to simply close for the entire day when an event is to be hosted there. Your staff makes no effort to accommodate your guests or help them find their way- they are too focused on nonsense like making 132 inch tablecloths fit on a 40 inch round table. (Whose idea was that anyway??) About 60 minutes into my visit, after several frustrating attempts navigate the map I found on the wall, I finally found myself in the contemporary art section of the museum and had just begun to observe a large display when a security guard approached me and tapped his watch and ushered me out the door, muttering \"The museum's closing...\" I'll admit, I did hear a voice over the PA system a few minutes prior, but the sound was so distorted, I couldn't understand what the voice was trying to say, and to be honest, I assumed they were speaking another language! When we were shooed out of the contemporary art exhibit, we made our way back to the coat room, collected our things, and fought our way through the crowd back to the front of the building. Once there, I had to navigate the crowd and find a place to put my coat on- being 30 degrees outside, I certainly wasn't fond of the idea of walking out in a sleeveless dress! No sooner had I set my phone and clutch on a table when another elderly security guard approached me and said, \"They're using this table for the party.\" I replied, \"I understand. I am on my way out the door right now,\" while I tried to zip up my coat. He said again, \"This table is for the party. Someone you're with is going to have to hold this for you,\" and he made me STOP zipping my coat to pick up my phone and purse and hand them to my friend so that I could carry on trying to hurry out of his way. Truly, this experience was a frustrating and disappointing endeavor. I feel sick that I wasted money trying to fight my way in to see a few paintings. The entire time I was in the building, I felt like I was an unwanted nuisance.   \n",

The line for tickets took us 35 minutes. 5 minutes after the museum was opened they announced that Winny The Pooh exhibition was sold out. We finally entered the museum and 45 minutes later they announced of emergency and told all people to get out of the museum. We decided not to wait outside and walked away. Really bad experience. Also, there are a lot of kids and babies running around and disturbing the peace and quiet a museum should have.   \n",

The museum website, on which I booked for Pooh in advance, is far from clear that paying for admission to the special exhibition also pays for general admission to the museum, and makes no mention that one does not have to stand in line at the ticket counter if one has tickets to the special exhibition: one only has to show them to a guard for general entry to the museum. We might have asked a guard before standing in line, but the Huntington Avenue entrance is a bottleneck: visitors enter and stand around getting oriented, making everything confused. From the ticket counter, there's a sign pointing to the coat check, but from there we got to the pick-up only part of coat check and had to walk around the galleries to find the drop-off. Looking for the Pastels exhibition, we found a sign pointing to it, then nothing; in the end we spotted the sign over the exhibition entrance, far in the distance. For Pooh, we went to the gallery entrance at our appointed time, but were told to go to another space to queue, and then had to wait beyond our appointed time to allow earlier visitors to pass further into the show, something that didn't work very well and was a further confusion.   \n",

It is a lovely museum, very impressive from the outside, and there are a number of places to eat and drink in the museum. It is well located for public transport although I walked down from Kenmore square. The very disappointing thing about this museum were the large number of regular areas that were closed. Not only was it disappointing that the galleries were closed, but it also meant, that as someone who has mobility problems, I found it difficult to find a lift that I could use that did not end up in a dead end. There were some exhibits closed that I really wanted to see. The other disappointment was the very large number of school parties that were visiting. This meant that moving around the museum was challenging because being young people they were not aware of anything outside their world, including people trying to get through the corridors that they were spread across. The museum acoustics were also quite poor, so the children shrieking at each other was amplified. There seemed to be no attempts to keep their voices down a little so as not to interrupt the enjoyment of other visitors. It was a Friday in February, and maybe this is a day to avoid. Or the museum could try and regulate school visits so that they are more spread out across the week?   \n",

My sisters and I plan a trip in once every few months to have dinner, walk around, and then go for coffee and cannoli. Although we do still like to come here, it is not what it used to be. It's extrememly expensive, very crowded, and since all the improvement work on Boston, there is virtually no place to park a car. Sometimes feel it's just not worth it.   \n",

My family and friends walked all around the North End looking at all the buildings, brownstones, shops and some of the historic sites. They had a few artsy areas that were pretty cool. This place is spotless which is surprisingly great considering this is a city. Parking is not available so you'll need to pay to park in a garage. There is plenty of restaurants around as well. I felt this was ok. I'm glad I did this just really nothing great. Very similar to NYC.   \n",

The restaurants come and go and tend to be aimed at tourists. It's fun to walk around, but there it's far less an authentic Boston community than spots like Beacon Hill or the South End.   \n",

It has a ton of restaurants, cafes and historic landmarks that makes it one of the top touristy spots of Boston. But it is rare to hear the other side of the story, that of a very dirty neighborhood, full of rats, with over-priced mediocre restaurants â€“albeit very popularâ€“. It's definitely worth a walk around there, but if someone asked me if that's a must see of Boston, unless I knew they were very interested in seeing Paul Revere's house, the Old North Church or follow the Freedom Trail, I'd suggest to first do other things. Still, on a nice summer day it is worth a stroll.   \n",

      "The actors were good but there was way too much sitting and standing around in between the places they take you. In room one they assign you a person who participated in the tea party and they explain the events leading up to it. This part was good but drawn out. They then take you on the ship which was very boring. Not much to see. Kids threw tea over but weren't overly impressed by this. Kinda lame actually. Next, you stand or sit under a canopy for 15 min while the actor answers questions. Next you see two wives perspectives but they basically say the same thing as room one. Next you see the tea cheat and talking paintings of King George and Samuel Adams that explain the events once again. Last is a movie about the Revolutionary War. It was very educational but the waiting and standing around ruined it especially on a very hot day. I did not like the fact that they don't do reservations like they do in Washington DC. You get assigned a time that is 30 plus min after you buy the tickets so more waiting. Wall to wall people on this crowded day and lots of people cutting the line and walking up to the ticket counter on the other side of the line while the man in charge of the line chats with guests. Overall, it is educational, somewhat interactive but way too long and too pricey for what you really get.\n",

I believe they paid to go onboard to tour the real looking ship and participate in the revolution. The staff were dressed in historically appropriate attire and kids would probably really get a kick out of doing this. We checked out the gift shop too, but overall it just wasn't my 'cup of tea'.

I admire the fact that they have maintained the ballpark in the same location since 1912. I live in the Dallas/Fort Worth area and the Rangers are building a new park after only twenty years. So much for tradition. Now, as far as the tour, it was fairly unimpressive. This was more like a \"pick your seat\" day. All you did was walk around the seats and look at the stadium/field from different vantage points. That's great and should be part of the tour, but it left us wanting more. You don't get to see anything you couldn't see by just buying a game ticket. Didn't get on the field or in the dugouts, dressing rooms, broadcast booths, suites, underneath inner workings. Nothing but walk around in the stands. You will get a little bit of history about the Red Sox and the Stadium from the tour guide, but still left wanting more. This is the most historic Stadium in baseball, it should have a tour to match!\n",

So don't discard your Red Sox ticket or you'll pay $42.00 to park. The Seats in the State Street Pavilion are the best I've ever had. I've been going to Fenway for nearly 50 years. My wife and I were very excited to have seats in the State Street Pavilion. We made a dinner reservation in the restaurant. When we arrived we waited around thirty minutes for water. Our waitress apologized profusely and was very pleasent. We elected to eat from the buffet becuase of the selection and fear we would wait another long spell for dinner. The buffet was $43.00. The buffet had a number of interesting choices, but only a couple really hit it out of the park. The onion rings were over cooked, the carving station beef was flavorless and the hush puppies were more like marbles. The buffet also closed early so we weren't able to enjoy the meal and sample the items that looked appetizing. Our bill was $118.00 plus the tip. On the upside, the octopus salad, tandori chicken and pork sliders were very good. Next time we'll order of the menu. We could have saved money and enjoyed dinner more.\n",

There were approximately 70 to 100 people in a herd with a tour guide and microphone. Although Fenway is on the National Register of Historic Places the guide only made mention of this. I would have liked to learn about Fenway's construction....Who were the workers who built it? What did it cost to construct? What VIPS attended games? How about a tour of the Dug Out and Locker Room when the team is on the Road. There was a fund raiser on the field the day I went. Better to close the tour and let us tourists walk the warming track, See the Bull Pen, Hear from the score keepers who post the runs, strikes and outs from inside the Score Board. Although elevators exist which I needed to get around the stadium I was ushered around the building separately from the tour guide and group as a whole. I appreciated the consideration however a knowledgeable alternate tour guide would have been desirable, Overall, my experience was a 6.5 on scale of 10 for want of some the missing elements I mention above and the possibility of missing more of what the tour guide had to say after being ushered away from the group.

      "Spent $500 bucks on two tickets in Loge Box 158, Third Base side lower level. We were 20 or so rows from the field. The seats had to have been installed in 1916 and were very uncomfortable and cramped. I had to literally take turns with the fan beside me putting my arms down at my side. The way the park is set up with the support beams and angles of the seats there are many obstructed views of the field. We could see nothing from left center field to the foul pole due to the angle of our seating and the construction of the left field seating wall. The constant flow of vendors carrying wares in front of us obstructed our view as well due the slight slope of the seating to the field level. I Love Boston and The Sox but will probably not go back to Fenway again and will definitely not sit anywhere on 3rd Base side. The Fans were Awesome! We had a great time before the game walking the park and visiting with people in and around the Park. If you want a Beer or Drink bring your ID. We are in our 60â€™s and could not buy a cold one having no idea of this restriction. They need a better way to handle this as even the vendors out in the stands carded, which added more obstruction to fans views. Sox Won Big.\n",

      "I was in Boston for two days. On the second day, I went with a friend to the museum. We arrived shortly after 2pm. I paid $25 for my ticket, and after the transaction was over, I found a tiny sign in the hall that said the museum would be closing at 4pm that evening for a private event, which left us with less than two hours to view the art. After waiting in line to check our coats, we had about 90 minutes. The museum is confusing and difficult to navigate. The exhibits are not labeled nor are they easily located. Some pieces of art don't even have a sign describing the pieces. Most of the rooms are cavernous but nearly empty- the canvases are scattered out along the walls in no real comprehensive order, and the small placards on the walls offer little to no insight of the pieces you see. Our struggling to navigate the museum was hindered even more by the \"private event\" they were planning. All around us, associates carried tables, tablecloths, steamers, chairs, and cables, without any mind to the paying guests all around them. Honestly, my piece of advice for this establishment would be to simply close for the entire day when an event is to be hosted there. Your staff makes no effort to accommodate your guests or help them find their way- they are too focused on nonsense like making 132 inch tablecloths fit on a 40 inch round table. (Whose idea was that anyway??) About 60 minutes into my visit, after several frustrating attempts navigate the map I found on the wall, I finally found myself in the contemporary art section of the museum and had just begun to observe a large display when a security guard approached me and tapped his watch and ushered me out the door, muttering \"The museum's closing...\" I'll admit, I did hear a voice over the PA system a few minutes prior, but the sound was so distorted, I couldn't understand what the voice was trying to say, and to be honest, I assumed they were speaking another language! When we were shooed out of the contemporary art exhibit, we made our way back to the coat room, collected our things, and fought our way through the crowd back to the front of the building. Once there, I had to navigate the crowd and find a place to put my coat on- being 30 degrees outside, I certainly wasn't fond of the idea of walking out in a sleeveless dress! No sooner had I set my phone and clutch on a table when another elderly security guard approached me and said, \"They're using this table for the party.\" I replied, \"I understand. I am on my way out the door right now,\" while I tried to zip up my coat. He said again, \"This table is for the party. Someone you're with is going to have to hold this for you,\" and he made me STOP zipping my coat to pick up my phone and purse and hand them to my friend so that I could carry on trying to hurry out of his way. Truly, this experience was a frustrating and disappointing endeavor. I feel sick that I wasted money trying to fight my way in to see a few paintings. The entire time I was in the building, I felt like I was an unwanted nuisance.\n",

The museum website, on which I booked for Pooh in advance, is far from clear that paying for admission to the special exhibition also pays for general admission to the museum, and makes no mention that one does not have to stand in line at the ticket counter if one has tickets to the special exhibition: one only has to show them to a guard for general entry to the museum. We might have asked a guard before standing in line, but the Huntington Avenue entrance is a bottleneck: visitors enter and stand around getting oriented, making everything confused. From the ticket counter, there's a sign pointing to the coat check, but from there we got to the pick-up only part of coat check and had to walk around the galleries to find the drop-off. Looking for the Pastels exhibition, we found a sign pointing to it, then nothing; in the end we spotted the sign over the exhibition entrance, far in the distance. For Pooh, we went to the gallery entrance at our appointed time, but were told to go to another space to queue, and then had to wait beyond our appointed time to allow earlier visitors to pass further into the show, something that didn't work very well and was a further confusion.\n",

It is well located for public transport although I walked down from Kenmore square. The very disappointing thing about this museum were the large number of regular areas that were closed. Not only was it disappointing that the galleries were closed, but it also meant, that as someone who has mobility problems, I found it difficult to find a lift that I could use that did not end up in a dead end. There were some exhibits closed that I really wanted to see. The other disappointment was the very large number of school parties that were visiting. This meant that moving around the museum was challenging because being young people they were not aware of anything outside their world, including people trying to get through the corridors that they were spread across. The museum acoustics were also quite poor, so the children shrieking at each other was amplified. There seemed to be no attempts to keep their voices down a little so as not to interrupt the enjoyment of other visitors. It was a Friday in February, and maybe this is a day to avoid. Or the museum could try and regulate school visits so that they are more spread out across the week?\n",

The seats had to have been installed in 1916 and were very uncomfortable and cramped. I had to literally take turns with the fan beside me putting my arms down at my side. The way the park is set up with the support beams and angles of the seats there are many obstructed views of the field. We could see nothing from left center field to the foul pole due to the angle of our seating and the construction of the left field seating wall. The constant flow of vendors carrying wares in front of us obstructed our view as well due the slight slope of the seating to the field level. I Love Boston and The Sox but will probably not go back to Fenway again and will definitely not sit anywhere on 3rd Base side. The Fans were Awesome! We had a great time before the game walking the park and visiting with people in and around the Park. If you want a Beer or Drink bring your ID. We are in our 60â€™s and could not buy a cold one having no idea of this restriction. They need a better way to handle this as even the vendors out in the stands carded, which added more obstruction to fans views. Sox Won Big.</td>\n",

It is well located for public transport although I walked down from Kenmore square. The very disappointing thing about this museum were the large number of regular areas that were closed. Not only was it disappointing that the galleries were closed, but it also meant, that as someone who has mobility problems, I found it difficult to find a lift that I could use that did not end up in a dead end. There were some exhibits closed that I really wanted to see. The other disappointment was the very large number of school parties that were visiting. This meant that moving around the museum was challenging because being young people they were not aware of anything outside their world, including people trying to get through the corridors that they were spread across. The museum acoustics were also quite poor, so the children shrieking at each other was amplified. There seemed to be no attempts to keep their voices down a little so as not to interrupt the enjoyment of other visitors. It was a Friday in February, and maybe this is a day to avoid. Or the museum could try and regulate school visits so that they are more spread out across the week?</td>\n",

       "      <td>I was in Boston for two days. On the second day, I went with a friend to the museum. We arrived shortly after 2pm. I paid $25 for my ticket, and after the transaction was over, I found a tiny sign in the hall that said the museum would be closing at 4pm that evening for a private event, which left us with less than two hours to view the art. After waiting in line to check our coats, we had about 90 minutes. The museum is confusing and difficult to navigate. The exhibits are not labeled nor are they easily located. Some pieces of art don't even have a sign describing the pieces. Most of the rooms are cavernous but nearly empty- the canvases are scattered out along the walls in no real comprehensive order, and the small placards on the walls offer little to no insight of the pieces you see. Our struggling to navigate the museum was hindered even more by the \"private event\" they were planning. All around us, associates carried tables, tablecloths, steamers, chairs, and cables, without any mind to the paying guests all around them. Honestly, my piece of advice for this establishment would be to simply close for the entire day when an event is to be hosted there. Your staff makes no effort to accommodate your guests or help them find their way- they are too focused on nonsense like making 132 inch tablecloths fit on a 40 inch round table. (Whose idea was that anyway??) About 60 minutes into my visit, after several frustrating attempts navigate the map I found on the wall, I finally found myself in the contemporary art section of the museum and had just begun to observe a large display when a security guard approached me and tapped his watch and ushered me out the door, muttering \"The museum's closing...\" I'll admit, I did hear a voice over the PA system a few minutes prior, but the sound was so distorted, I couldn't understand what the voice was trying to say, and to be honest, I assumed they were speaking another language! When we were shooed out of the contemporary art exhibit, we made our way back to the coat room, collected our things, and fought our way through the crowd back to the front of the building. Once there, I had to navigate the crowd and find a place to put my coat on- being 30 degrees outside, I certainly wasn't fond of the idea of walking out in a sleeveless dress! No sooner had I set my phone and clutch on a table when another elderly security guard approached me and said, \"They're using this table for the party.\" I replied, \"I understand. I am on my way out the door right now,\" while I tried to zip up my coat. He said again, \"This table is for the party. Someone you're with is going to have to hold this for you,\" and he made me STOP zipping my coat to pick up my phone and purse and hand them to my friend so that I could carry on trying to hurry out of his way. Truly, this experience was a frustrating and disappointing endeavor. I feel sick that I wasted money trying to fight my way in to see a few paintings. The entire time I was in the building, I felt like I was an unwanted nuisance.</td>\n",

Although we do still like to come here, it is not what it used to be. It's extrememly expensive, very crowded, and since all the improvement work on Boston, there is virtually no place to park a car. Sometimes feel it's just not worth it.</td>\n",

The line for tickets took us 35 minutes. 5 minutes after the museum was opened they announced that Winny The Pooh exhibition was sold out. We finally entered the museum and 45 minutes later they announced of emergency and told all people to get out of the museum. We decided not to wait outside and walked away. Really bad experience. Also, there are a lot of kids and babies running around and disturbing the peace and quiet a museum should have.</td>\n",

We were 20 or so rows from the field. The seats had to have been installed in 1916 and were very uncomfortable and cramped. I had to literally take turns with the fan beside me putting my arms down at my side. The way the park is set up with the support beams and angles of the seats there are many obstructed views of the field. We could see nothing from left center field to the foul pole due to the angle of our seating and the construction of the left field seating wall. The constant flow of vendors carrying wares in front of us obstructed our view as well due the slight slope of the seating to the field level. I Love Boston and The Sox but will probably not go back to Fenway again and will definitely not sit anywhere on 3rd Base side. The Fans were Awesome! We had a great time before the game walking the park and visiting with people in and around the Park. If you want a Beer or Drink bring your ID. We are in our 60â€™s and could not buy a cold one having no idea of this restriction. They need a better way to handle this as even the vendors out in the stands carded, which added more obstruction to fans views. Sox Won Big.  \n",

It's a nice small exhibition, mostly played by actors and contains visual effects. Not a regular museum you are expected to see. As for my boy it was boring especially if English isn't your language. So it looks like more as a small show on very low level. Don't waste your time and money, just take a walk around .  \n",

It is a lovely museum, very impressive from the outside, and there are a number of places to eat and drink in the museum. It is well located for public transport although I walked down from Kenmore square. The very disappointing thing about this museum were the large number of regular areas that were closed. Not only was it disappointing that the galleries were closed, but it also meant, that as someone who has mobility problems, I found it difficult to find a lift that I could use that did not end up in a dead end. There were some exhibits closed that I really wanted to see. The other disappointment was the very large number of school parties that were visiting. This meant that moving around the museum was challenging because being young people they were not aware of anything outside their world, including people trying to get through the corridors that they were spread across. The museum acoustics were also quite poor, so the children shrieking at each other was amplified. There seemed to be no attempts to keep their voices down a little so as not to interrupt the enjoyment of other visitors. It was a Friday in February, and maybe this is a day to avoid. Or the museum could try and regulate school visits so that they are more spread out across the week?  \n",

       "21537  I was in Boston for two days. On the second day, I went with a friend to the museum. We arrived shortly after 2pm. I paid $25 for my ticket, and after the transaction was over, I found a tiny sign in the hall that said the museum would be closing at 4pm that evening for a private event, which left us with less than two hours to view the art. After waiting in line to check our coats, we had about 90 minutes. The museum is confusing and difficult to navigate. The exhibits are not labeled nor are they easily located. Some pieces of art don't even have a sign describing the pieces. Most of the rooms are cavernous but nearly empty- the canvases are scattered out along the walls in no real comprehensive order, and the small placards on the walls offer little to no insight of the pieces you see. Our struggling to navigate the museum was hindered even more by the \"private event\" they were planning. All around us, associates carried tables, tablecloths, steamers, chairs, and cables, without any mind to the paying guests all around them. Honestly, my piece of advice for this establishment would be to simply close for the entire day when an event is to be hosted there. Your staff makes no effort to accommodate your guests or help them find their way- they are too focused on nonsense like making 132 inch tablecloths fit on a 40 inch round table. (Whose idea was that anyway??) About 60 minutes into my visit, after several frustrating attempts navigate the map I found on the wall, I finally found myself in the contemporary art section of the museum and had just begun to observe a large display when a security guard approached me and tapped his watch and ushered me out the door, muttering \"The museum's closing...\" I'll admit, I did hear a voice over the PA system a few minutes prior, but the sound was so distorted, I couldn't understand what the voice was trying to say, and to be honest, I assumed they were speaking another language! When we were shooed out of the contemporary art exhibit, we made our way back to the coat room, collected our things, and fought our way through the crowd back to the front of the building. Once there, I had to navigate the crowd and find a place to put my coat on- being 30 degrees outside, I certainly wasn't fond of the idea of walking out in a sleeveless dress! No sooner had I set my phone and clutch on a table when another elderly security guard approached me and said, \"They're using this table for the party.\" I replied, \"I understand. I am on my way out the door right now,\" while I tried to zip up my coat. He said again, \"This table is for the party. Someone you're with is going to have to hold this for you,\" and he made me STOP zipping my coat to pick up my phone and purse and hand them to my friend so that I could carry on trying to hurry out of his way. Truly, this experience was a frustrating and disappointing endeavor. I feel sick that I wasted money trying to fight my way in to see a few paintings. The entire time I was in the building, I felt like I was an unwanted nuisance.  \n",

It excluded going on the field, in the dugout, or into the locker rooms. We basically just walked around the concourse and that was it. Not impressed.  \n",

My sisters and I plan a trip in once every few months to have dinner, walk around, and then go for coffee and cannoli. Although we do still like to come here, it is not what it used to be. It's extrememly expensive, very crowded, and since all the improvement work on Boston, there is virtually no place to park a car. Sometimes feel it's just not worth it.  \n",

The line for tickets took us 35 minutes. 5 minutes after the museum was opened they announced that Winny The Pooh exhibition was sold out. We finally entered the museum and 45 minutes later they announced of emergency and told all people to get out of the museum. We decided not to wait outside and walked away. Really bad experience. Also, there are a lot of kids and babies running around and disturbing the peace and quiet a museum should have.  \n",

Yes, the 'cast' is enthusiastic, though a little thrown off by in depth questions about the tenor of the times - the assumption is that (most) everyone shared the same views in 1773 - nut the ship tour is a total reconstruction, you're herded through the museum, the videos are mostly perfunctory (though with a cool picture come to life effect, and the sole surviving tea chest was interesting / although its spinning presentation like a priceless gem is a bit much) and the entire history lesson would occupy a couple pages of text. Again, if you have kids and are willnig to shell out - great. Solo, and know something about history - your money might be better spent elsewhere.</td>\n",

You get to visit one of 2 ships which were involved in the tea party to experience life in the 1770s.

We paid $59 for both of us and of all the things that we did on our three week trip to New England this was by far the biggest waste of money. The tour starts in a mock up of the Old Meeting house and is conducted by two role playing guides. The whole presentation is aimed at young children - probably 5 to 10 year olds - fair enough but we hoped we would be able to read the info in the exhibits. However, the issue is that everything is rushed and the very few things to read/look at that are in the \"museum\" you are not given time to take in. When we went out to the boat the guide gave his talk on the top deck and then asked everybody to go down to the next deck where he would continue the tour. There were two sets of stairs going down but we were told we could only use one. We were at the back of a large group, thirty or forty people, and by the time we had filed downstairs the guide was already half way through his talk so we missed it (no waiting allowed as they have to clear the room for the next group). After the talk the group were very quickly led around the lower deck in single file and back up the other stairs - no time to really look at anything. We then went on the quayside for another short discourse from the guide where there were some poster exhibits to read. However, by the time we filed off the boat at the back of the group we were told to move on and did not have time to read any of the exhibits. This happened throughout the rest of the \"tour\". The whole thing lasted less than an hour and was a total waste of time and money! Give this a miss - your time is much better spent exploring many of the other excellent attractions in Boston especially the Navy Dockyard where you get as much time as you want to spend on two real boats!</td>\n",

I paid $25 for my ticket, and after the transaction was over, I found a tiny sign in the hall that said the museum would be closing at 4pm that evening for a private event, which left us with less than two hours to view the art. After waiting in line to check our coats, we had about 90 minutes. The museum is confusing and difficult to navigate. The exhibits are not labeled nor are they easily located. Some pieces of art don't even have a sign describing the pieces. Most of the rooms are cavernous but nearly empty- the canvases are scattered out along the walls in no real comprehensive order, and the small placards on the walls offer little to no insight of the pieces you see. Our struggling to navigate the museum was hindered even more by the \"private event\" they were planning. All around us, associates carried tables, tablecloths, steamers, chairs, and cables, without any mind to the paying guests all around them. Honestly, my piece of advice for this establishment would be to simply close for the entire day when an event is to be hosted there. Your staff makes no effort to accommodate your guests or help them find their way- they are too focused on nonsense like making 132 inch tablecloths fit on a 40 inch round table. (Whose idea was that anyway??) About 60 minutes into my visit, after several frustrating attempts navigate the map I found on the wall, I finally found myself in the contemporary art section of the museum and had just begun to observe a large display when a security guard approached me and tapped his watch and ushered me out the door, muttering \"The museum's closing...\" I'll admit, I did hear a voice over the PA system a few minutes prior, but the sound was so distorted, I couldn't understand what the voice was trying to say, and to be honest, I assumed they were speaking another language! When we were shooed out of the contemporary art exhibit, we made our way back to the coat room, collected our things, and fought our way through the crowd back to the front of the building. Once there, I had to navigate the crowd and find a place to put my coat on- being 30 degrees outside, I certainly wasn't fond of the idea of walking out in a sleeveless dress! No sooner had I set my phone and clutch on a table when another elderly security guard approached me and said, \"They're using this table for the party.\" I replied, \"I understand. I am on my way out the door right now,\" while I tried to zip up my coat. He said again, \"This table is for the party. Someone you're with is going to have to hold this for you,\" and he made me STOP zipping my coat to pick up my phone and purse and hand them to my friend so that I could carry on trying to hurry out of his way. Truly, this experience was a frustrating and disappointing endeavor. I feel sick that I wasted money trying to fight my way in to see a few paintings. The entire time I was in the building, I felt like I was an unwanted nuisance.</td>\n",

It's a nice small exhibition, mostly played by actors and contains visual effects. Not a regular museum you are expected to see. As for my boy it was boring especially if English isn't your language. So it looks like more as a small show on very low level. Don't waste your time and money, just take a walk around .   \n",

I wouldn't do it again. Actors did an amazing job; but once you paid, you were at the timeline mercy of the museum. You can't stay and linger and look. You get herded into the museum store, so you can part with more of your money. Info was good; but there's not enough time to view it.   \n",

As an adult, I could have skipped it. Yes, the 'cast' is enthusiastic, though a little thrown off by in depth questions about the tenor of the times - the assumption is that (most) everyone shared the same views in 1773 - nut the ship tour is a total reconstruction, you're herded through the museum, the videos are mostly perfunctory (though with a cool picture come to life effect, and the sole surviving tea chest was interesting / although its spinning presentation like a priceless gem is a bit much) and the entire history lesson would occupy a couple pages of text. Again, if you have kids and are willnig to shell out - great. Solo, and know something about history - your money might be better spent elsewhere.   \n",

Visitors are encouraged to participate with cheers and boos, so be prepared. You are taken through key events either by the actors or through high-tech multimedia performances. You get to visit one of 2 ships which were involved in the tea party to experience life in the 1770s. The whole tour lasts just over an hour but it all felt very rushed and highly organised, as visitors are shepherded from one event to the next. There was not enough time to read and digest the displays on the wharf. It was definitely a money-making enterprise with the object being to push tours through to the gift shop and the tea room.   \n",

We paid $59 for both of us and of all the things that we did on our three week trip to New England this was by far the biggest waste of money. The tour starts in a mock up of the Old Meeting house and is conducted by two role playing guides. The whole presentation is aimed at young children - probably 5 to 10 year olds - fair enough but we hoped we would be able to read the info in the exhibits. However, the issue is that everything is rushed and the very few things to read/look at that are in the \"museum\" you are not given time to take in. When we went out to the boat the guide gave his talk on the top deck and then asked everybody to go down to the next deck where he would continue the tour. There were two sets of stairs going down but we were told we could only use one. We were at the back of a large group, thirty or forty people, and by the time we had filed downstairs the guide was already half way through his talk so we missed it (no waiting allowed as they have to clear the room for the next group). After the talk the group were very quickly led around the lower deck in single file and back up the other stairs - no time to really look at anything. We then went on the quayside for another short discourse from the guide where there were some poster exhibits to read. However, by the time we filed off the boat at the back of the group we were told to move on and did not have time to read any of the exhibits. This happened throughout the rest of the \"tour\". The whole thing lasted less than an hour and was a total waste of time and money! Give this a miss - your time is much better spent exploring many of the other excellent attractions in Boston especially the Navy Dockyard where you get as much time as you want to spend on two real boats!   \n",

There were several other families there at the same time having the same problem. The company we bought the tickets through is supposed to issue a refund but that doesn't help the fact that we wasted over an hour dealing with this on our one day in Boston when we could have spent the time elsewhere. In my opinion you shouldn't sell tickets through 3rd parties if you aren't able to manage the number of tickets sold and turn people away who have spent time and money to see the museum. Very disappointed in how this was handled.   \n",

There was a ten dollar reduction if you had used the trolley bus. The film at the end was the best bit for us.   \n",

Late opening of the ticket window and Automation problems led to standing there for 30 minutes. I guess I should be great full as that translated to less time spending crazy money. I have been to baseball stadiums all over the world but this one must be the most expensive. $5 for bottled water.   \n",

We have visited and taken in a game at almost all the parks and this one is by far THE most uncomfortable. Sight lines are horrible wherever you sit and some seats are angled so that you will have neck problems the next day. The seats are small and uncomfortable. But the fans are rabid and love their Sox, and their joy at being there is infectious. You can't help but have a good time. Bring lots of money though because the souvenirs and the food is expensive, as well as the seats themselves.   \n",

The parking was only $18.00, but you have to scan your Red Sox Ticket at the exit gate to get the rate. So don't discard your Red Sox ticket or you'll pay $42.00 to park. The Seats in the State Street Pavilion are the best I've ever had. I've been going to Fenway for nearly 50 years. My wife and I were very excited to have seats in the State Street Pavilion. We made a dinner reservation in the restaurant. When we arrived we waited around thirty minutes for water. Our waitress apologized profusely and was very pleasent. We elected to eat from the buffet becuase of the selection and fear we would wait another long spell for dinner. The buffet was $43.00. The buffet had a number of interesting choices, but only a couple really hit it out of the park. The onion rings were over cooked, the carving station beef was flavorless and the hush puppies were more like marbles. The buffet also closed early so we weren't able to enjoy the meal and sample the items that looked appetizing. Our bill was $118.00 plus the tip. On the upside, the octopus salad, tandori chicken and pork sliders were very good. Next time we'll order of the menu. We could have saved money and enjoyed dinner more.   \n",

You could not hear the tour guide at all. He spoke way too fast and the sound quality was poor. He would start talking before the entire group was with him. All you get to see are the various seating sections which you can see at a game and a small museum. There are so many other sights to visit in Boston that are worthwhile.   \n",

Nothing was disclosed that park was being worked on. Construction was being fine everywhere. The tour guide rushed the whole group through and was not very friendly or informative. I was told I should just be happy I was seeing the park. Our tour cost 90 a person. It was horrible. Petco park in San Diego was amazing but this not worth your time or money.   \n",

We followed him for two hours as he talked all about the Battle of Bunker Hill. That was great. Then we continued on the trail. They have red bricks in the ground to follow but then they just stop sometimes or you run right into major construction. The Paul Revere Park was closed so you had to take a detour and that was easy to get lost, as many people were. The other more interesting sites on the trail you have to pay for and they want a lot of money to see Paul Revere's house and other places. Then it just kind of peters out before you get to the Boston Commons. Very busy with people and cars, which drive too fast on the smaller roads and don't seem to care that there are tourists about or just aren't paying attention. Not really worth it after Bunker Hill.   \n",
       "21537  I was in Boston for two days. On the second day, I went with a friend to the museum. We arrived shortly after 2pm. I paid $25 for my ticket, and after the transaction was over, I found a tiny sign in the hall that said the museum would be closing at 4pm that evening for a private event, which left us with less than two hours to view the art. After waiting in line to check our coats, we had about 90 minutes. The museum is confusing and difficult to navigate. The exhibits are not labeled nor are they easily located. Some pieces of art don't even have a sign describing the pieces. Most of the rooms are cavernous but nearly empty- the canvases are scattered out along the walls in no real comprehensive order, and the small placards on the walls offer little to no insight of the pieces you see. Our struggling to navigate the museum was hindered even more by the \"private event\" they were planning. All around us, associates carried tables, tablecloths, steamers, chairs, and cables, without any mind to the paying guests all around them. Honestly, my piece of advice for this establishment would be to simply close for the entire day when an event is to be hosted there. Your staff makes no effort to accommodate your guests or help them find their way- they are too focused on nonsense like making 132 inch tablecloths fit on a 40 inch round table. (Whose idea was that anyway??) About 60 minutes into my visit, after several frustrating attempts navigate the map I found on the wall, I finally found myself in the contemporary art section of the museum and had just begun to observe a large display when a security guard approached me and tapped his watch and ushered me out the door, muttering \"The museum's closing...\" I'll admit, I did hear a voice over the PA system a few minutes prior, but the sound was so distorted, I couldn't understand what the voice was trying to say, and to be honest, I assumed they were speaking another language! When we were shooed out of the contemporary art exhibit, we made our way back to the coat room, collected our things, and fought our way through the crowd back to the front of the building. Once there, I had to navigate the crowd and find a place to put my coat on- being 30 degrees outside, I certainly wasn't fond of the idea of walking out in a sleeveless dress! No sooner had I set my phone and clutch on a table when another elderly security guard approached me and said, \"They're using this table for the party.\" I replied, \"I understand. I am on my way out the door right now,\" while I tried to zip up my coat. He said again, \"This table is for the party. Someone you're with is going to have to hold this for you,\" and he made me STOP zipping my coat to pick up my phone and purse and hand them to my friend so that I could carry on trying to hurry out of his way. Truly, this experience was a frustrating and disappointing endeavor. I feel sick that I wasted money trying to fight my way in to see a few paintings. The entire time I was in the building, I felt like I was an unwanted nuisance.   \n",

      "I visited this museum with my 13 years boy. It's a nice small exhibition, mostly played by actors and contains visual effects. Not a regular museum you are expected to see. As for my boy it was boring especially if English isn't your language. So it looks like more as a small show on very low level. Don't waste your time and money, just take a walk around .\n",

      "Possibly great for kids, younger teens. As an adult, I could have skipped it. Yes, the 'cast' is enthusiastic, though a little thrown off by in depth questions about the tenor of the times - the assumption is that (most) everyone shared the same views in 1773 - nut the ship tour is a total reconstruction, you're herded through the museum, the videos are mostly perfunctory (though with a cool picture come to life effect, and the sole surviving tea chest was interesting / although its spinning presentation like a priceless gem is a bit much) and the entire history lesson would occupy a couple pages of text. Again, if you have kids and are willnig to shell out - great. Solo, and know something about history - your money might be better spent elsewhere.\n",

      "This tour, led by actors in period costume, re-enacts events leading up to, and after the Boston tea party. Visitors are encouraged to participate with cheers and boos, so be prepared. You are taken through key events either by the actors or through high-tech multimedia performances. You get to visit one of 2 ships which were involved in the tea party to experience life in the 1770s. The whole tour lasts just over an hour but it all felt very rushed and highly organised, as visitors are shepherded from one event to the next. There was not enough time to read and digest the displays on the wharf. It was definitely a money-making enterprise with the object being to push tours through to the gift shop and the tea room.\n",

      "My wife and I were on a trip to Boston sightseeing and was looking forward to visiting this attraction. We paid $59 for both of us and of all the things that we did on our three week trip to New England this was by far the biggest waste of money. The tour starts in a mock up of the Old Meeting house and is conducted by two role playing guides. The whole presentation is aimed at young children - probably 5 to 10 year olds - fair enough but we hoped we would be able to read the info in the exhibits. However, the issue is that everything is rushed and the very few things to read/look at that are in the \"museum\" you are not given time to take in. When we went out to the boat the guide gave his talk on the top deck and then asked everybody to go down to the next deck where he would continue the tour. There were two sets of stairs going down but we were told we could only use one. We were at the back of a large group, thirty or forty people, and by the time we had filed downstairs the guide was already half way through his talk so we missed it (no waiting allowed as they have to clear the room for the next group). After the talk the group were very quickly led around the lower deck in single file and back up the other stairs - no time to really look at anything. We then went on the quayside for another short discourse from the guide where there were some poster exhibits to read. However, by the time we filed off the boat at the back of the group we were told to move on and did not have time to read any of the exhibits. This happened throughout the rest of the \"tour\". The whole thing lasted less than an hour and was a total waste of time and money! Give this a miss - your time is much better spent exploring many of the other excellent attractions in Boston especially the Navy Dockyard where you get as much time as you want to spend on two real boats!\n",

      "We pre-purchased tickets in a package in the morning and arrived around 2pm to be told that they weren't selling any more tickets for the day and we wouldn't be able to enter even though we had already paid for our tickets. There were several other families there at the same time having the same problem. The company we bought the tickets through is supposed to issue a refund but that doesn't help the fact that we wasted over an hour dealing with this on our one day in Boston when we could have spent the time elsewhere. In my opinion you shouldn't sell tickets through 3rd parties if you aren't able to manage the number of tickets sold and turn people away who have spent time and money to see the museum. Very disappointed in how this was handled.\n",

But the fans are rabid and love their Sox, and their joy at being there is infectious. You can't help but have a good time.

So don't discard your Red Sox ticket or you'll pay $42.00 to park. The Seats in the State Street Pavilion are the best I've ever had. I've been going to Fenway for nearly 50 years. My wife and I were very excited to have seats in the State Street Pavilion. We made a dinner reservation in the restaurant. When we arrived we waited around thirty minutes for water. Our waitress apologized profusely and was very pleasent. We elected to eat from the buffet becuase of the selection and fear we would wait another long spell for dinner. The buffet was $43.00. The buffet had a number of interesting choices, but only a couple really hit it out of the park. The onion rings were over cooked, the carving station beef was flavorless and the hush puppies were more like marbles. The buffet also closed early so we weren't able to enjoy the meal and sample the items that looked appetizing. Our bill was $118.00 plus the tip. On the upside, the octopus salad, tandori chicken and pork sliders were very good. Next time we'll order of the menu. We could have saved money and enjoyed dinner more.\n",

We followed him for two hours as he talked all about the Battle of Bunker Hill. That was great. Then we continued on the trail. They have red bricks in the ground to follow but then they just stop sometimes or you run right into major construction. The Paul Revere Park was closed so you had to take a detour and that was easy to get lost, as many people were. The other more interesting sites on the trail you have to pay for and they want a lot of money to see Paul Revere's house and other places. Then it just kind of peters out before you get to the Boston Commons. Very busy with people and cars, which drive too fast on the smaller roads and don't seem to care that there are tourists about or just aren't paying attention. Not really worth it after Bunker Hill.\n",

      "I was in Boston for two days. On the second day, I went with a friend to the museum. We arrived shortly after 2pm. I paid $25 for my ticket, and after the transaction was over, I found a tiny sign in the hall that said the museum would be closing at 4pm that evening for a private event, which left us with less than two hours to view the art. After waiting in line to check our coats, we had about 90 minutes. The museum is confusing and difficult to navigate. The exhibits are not labeled nor are they easily located. Some pieces of art don't even have a sign describing the pieces. Most of the rooms are cavernous but nearly empty- the canvases are scattered out along the walls in no real comprehensive order, and the small placards on the walls offer little to no insight of the pieces you see. Our struggling to navigate the museum was hindered even more by the \"private event\" they were planning. All around us, associates carried tables, tablecloths, steamers, chairs, and cables, without any mind to the paying guests all around them. Honestly, my piece of advice for this establishment would be to simply close for the entire day when an event is to be hosted there. Your staff makes no effort to accommodate your guests or help them find their way- they are too focused on nonsense like making 132 inch tablecloths fit on a 40 inch round table. (Whose idea was that anyway??) About 60 minutes into my visit, after several frustrating attempts navigate the map I found on the wall, I finally found myself in the contemporary art section of the museum and had just begun to observe a large display when a security guard approached me and tapped his watch and ushered me out the door, muttering \"The museum's closing...\" I'll admit, I did hear a voice over the PA system a few minutes prior, but the sound was so distorted, I couldn't understand what the voice was trying to say, and to be honest, I assumed they were speaking another language! When we were shooed out of the contemporary art exhibit, we made our way back to the coat room, collected our things, and fought our way through the crowd back to the front of the building. Once there, I had to navigate the crowd and find a place to put my coat on- being 30 degrees outside, I certainly wasn't fond of the idea of walking out in a sleeveless dress! No sooner had I set my phone and clutch on a table when another elderly security guard approached me and said, \"They're using this table for the party.\" I replied, \"I understand. I am on my way out the door right now,\" while I tried to zip up my coat. He said again, \"This table is for the party. Someone you're with is going to have to hold this for you,\" and he made me STOP zipping my coat to pick up my phone and purse and hand them to my friend so that I could carry on trying to hurry out of his way. Truly, this experience was a frustrating and disappointing endeavor. I feel sick that I wasted money trying to fight my way in to see a few paintings. The entire time I was in the building, I felt like I was an unwanted nuisance.\n",

      "This tour was so much fun. I would highly recommend it. It was an interactive tour where the guides dress up in costume and include you in the fun. When we arrived, we were given a character \"to play\" during the tour. Honestly, you didn't have to do anything with it. It was just fun to get the card with a little explanation of who you were supposed to be. The guides asked for volunteers to speak during the first part of the tour -- where they re-enacted a town meeting. So much fun. The kids loved it. At the end of the tour, we went to the tea house and had tea and hot chocolate. They also had sandwiches and pastries available to purchase as well. Well worth the visit.\n",

They have some very advanced technology that makes the events very real. I would highly recommend this event.\n",

      "Our tour guide \"Anne Bradley\" was amazing. She really pulled everyone into the performance. Sam Adams and the patriot on the ship were great too we just had more personal interaction with Anne due to the structure of the performance. I honestly did not expect to enjoy this as much as I did and the credit goes to the actors. Seeing the remaining original tea chest is worth admission alone. The ship is a realistic replica and there are two different historical ships so you may want to plan your tour to see the one you prefer. The tea shop/snack bar at the end us terrific and they don't gouge. The cost for unlimited samples of the five teas which were thrown overboard was a mere $4. A souvineer cup is only a couple dollats more. I would highly recommend this for everyone except very small children unable to walk or very ederly or impaired persons due to the steps and gangway which need to be navigated. I was so engaged I forgot to take photos!\n",

The guides give a very lively and fun introduction to the historic event which started many others on the Freedom Trail and shaped Boston and America as a whole. I'm not usually a fan of guided tours, but this was unique and would highly recommend! After this we headed on our own walk and discovery of the Freedom Trail and other things off its path. The gift shop is also one of the best in the city, many tea and fun historic souvenirs! You even get to taste the 5 teas that were dumped into the river and reenact your own tea throwing off the ship :)\n",

So, we bit the bullet and stayed a second day to go here. I'm so glad we did! They do a fantastic job of explaining the attitudes of the time and the atmosphere that evening. We would highly recommend this museum for all ages!\n",

So much more then throwing the tea in the harbor. I would encourage every junior high,high school and adult to do the museum. It was like a semester of American history in a hour and a half. And then the tea after and gift shop. I am not a huge gift shop buyer, yet I walked out with a few items I couldn't live without. The highlight of our Boston trip.\n",

They struck a happy balance of making it fun to join in, without making anyone shy feel â€˜on the spotâ€™.

Comparatively we got our money's worth compared to other tours in the area. Our Sons of Liberty guide played his part very well. All the others did too. The boat tour was interactive and the museum tour employed modern technology, which helped the experience and the perspectives of the time come to life. My sons were 17 and 18 and enjoyed the tour very much. I teach upper elementary-aged children and would highly recommend the experience for that age group as well.

      "What a fun experience! The museum really took pains to walk guests through the entire story of the Tea Party - not just the night itself, but the political atmosphere of what led up to it, and also the consequences of what came after. We joined a re-enactment of a meeting among the Sons, led by someone interpreting Sam Adams, and then followed a guide in cosplay down into the boat and got a good introduction to how a cargo ship looked and worked back in those days. After some spirited huzzahing we all got to take turns hurling tea chests overboard. Afterward came more information out on the docks, then into a small museum for a couple of movies and a re-enacted debate between Lord North and Sam Adams. By all this I mean to point out that the visit was well-paced, moving through several difference changes of scenery and different media modes, which keeps it fresh and interesting for the kiddies. It's also highly interactive. I would definitely recommend for anyone with a reasonably mature six-year old and up, assuming they have a modicum of interest in history. And if they don't yet, well, it might start here.\n",

Our guide â€˜John Singleton Copleyâ€™, but you can call me Jack - dressed resplendently in period costume -was awesome! His factual knowledge was immense, he was theatrical, amusing and very interesting. Really made for a great experience. We learnt so much of the history of Boston in the 80 mins or so we spent with the guide than we would have gleaned from wandering around on our own with a guide book. If there is any criticism, I think the group (around 35 people) was too large. 20-25 would have been better. We enjoyed the walk so much that we signed up to do another tour with him in the afternoon of the North End. This was a much smaller group (10/12) , and we were able to navigate the back streets and small walkways of â€˜Little Italyâ€™ with ease. Again, Jack was full of knowledge and fun facts and showed us parts of the city that we would (probably) not otherwise have ventured into with such abandon.

Obviously, dress for the weather--make sure you're warm enough to stroll and stand for what amounts to about an hour, between pick-p and tour's end.

      "Since there are over 16,000 reviews, I'm not sure my review will say much of anything different. But I would highly recommend this trail. It's a free walking trail and most was easily accessible with a stroller. We started by taking the T (Red line) to the Park station to start at Boston Commons. We strolled around the Commons for a little while and I thought this was a great place to let the toddler stretch his legs and get his sillies out while not worrying about running into the street. Note: stop #1 has a frog pond, which is a few inches deep, but starting the trail at 8am on a Monday, this is closed. Good place to hang out during the summer though! The red brick trail on the ground and signs saying \"Freedom Trail -->\" are very helpful. There are also many maps of the town around the downtown area. There were some other stops early in the trail that also don't open until like 9:30 or 10:30am, so again, had to look at the outside and continue down the trail. We stopped at the old state house and site of Boston massacre. This has 3 stories with steep staircase and from what I could tell, no handicap (Stroller) access that I could find. I ended up taking the toddler out and carrying the empty stroller up the few steps to get in the entrance. You must check strollers and backpacks with the staff behind the counter. Everyone loved the free samples at Quincy Market! We thought the Paul Revere Mall was a lovely, shaded area to rest. Once you pass through the mall area, there are about 9-10 steps to go up to stroll on to the next site. A nice passerby helped me climb. We walked all the way to Copp's Burial Ground, then headed towards North End T station. All in all took about 6 hours.\n",

      "I highly recommend talking with the Freedom Trail information center @ the Boston Commons. There are all kinds of tours going on and its easy to get confused. For us, the earliest history tour with a guide left @ 9:30 am from the Commons. Follow the red brick path through the center of downtown. It's really a full day activity if you stop and visit each point of interest along the trail. Some sites are free; some are not. I highly recommend watching the HBO mini series: John Adams prior to your visit. For my family: there are mandatory movie nights. This 6 part mini series with set the stage for understanding more about who and what was going in 1776 Boston. Then, the sites come alive as you walk the trail. The trail can be easily walked in a few hours; however, we spent time to visit each site arriving @ Faneuil Hall around lunch time. Then, off to Bunker Hill & the U.S.S. Constitution by 4:00 with a stop to visit the North Church. We ended the day with dinner @ the historic Warren Tavern in Charlotte town just a couple blocks down from Bunker Hill. One can do this with out the convenience of a hop on/ hop off trolley. Be careful in choosing a trolley that will fit your needs as the one we chose was not really convenient and tour friendly to meeting our hopes. The City View Trolley driver on our tour was correct; it would be better to start @ Bunker Hill and work one's way towards the Commons downtown. Cheers, GS\n",

      "We are visiting the city from Florida and have heard of the Freedom Trail for years. So we signed up for a tour as an add on to the Old Town Trolley Tours. We were part of a fairly large group of about 24 and our tour guide was \"Elizabeth Oliver\". She did a wonderful job with the narration of the tour and kept things fun and kept us all together. It was a great tour. I would highly recommend it and hope you get Arielle...I mean Elizabeth Oliver as your guide.\n",

      "We went with our 2 boys, 6 and 8, and did the trail by ourselves without a tour guide. it's a very long walk and some places get confusing as to where to go, but you can look it up online and get the directions. For most of the trail there is a red brick line that you follow. It's a fantastic idea for tourism, because it takes you through all parts of Boston, through nice neighborhoods, markets, rows of restaurants (which can also turn out to be terrible tourist traps), and all while seeing many historical landmarks. Many of the landmarks are museums now that charge an admission fee, so we skipped going in to most of them. It's neat to see where the Boston massacre took place, or where they read the Declaration of Independence to the people of Boston. Without a tour guide we could go at our own pace, stop when we wanted to and see what we wanted to. The day before we had done a Duck Tour, which I highly recommend to see the city and hear about the locations from a funny guide, while sitting in a \"bus/boat\". By doing that first we knew more about many of the locations we saw on the Freedom Trail. But you could also buy one of the many guides or maps that would tell you about it as well. We ended up barely making it to the USS Constellation and definitely not to Bunker Hill. It was just too far and everyone's feet were hurting. There is no subway out that far so we ended up having to Uber back to our hotel. We were there at the end of August and it was unusually hot, which makes it even worse of a walk. I highly recommend doing the trail, but not during the summer months. It's hot, humid, and you're in for a really long walk.\n",

I highly recommend the docent guided my guide really made history come alive. We got much more than just here sis building and here's what happened we got social and political insights along with wonderful anecdotal stories I had not heard before. The tour began at Boston Common and in it at Faneuil Hall, taking about 90 minutes. Our guide was quite knowledgeable, and encouraged questions as we went along. I loved every minute and I would do it again?\n",

Statuary, paintings, photographs, glass, musical instruments, furniture, etc. - it's all here. Your visit can be as simple as wanting to see a temporary exhibit of interest or a full day exploration. (To do full justice to everything at the MFA you would need more than a day.) We were partly drawn by a temporary exhibit but stayed 3 hours and touched on many of the genres. We will be back at the MFA during a future visit to Boston, highly recommended.\n",

      "This is an amazing museum. Usually I cringe when my husband mentions art museums--having lived in Europe for a couple of years, I'm not a fan of the abstract art that's usually at our museum in NC--my favorite part of that museum is the outdoor trail. This museum is amazing--collections of artifacts from various countries/time periods with placards that are easy to read and provide good relevant information. Actually seeing stone from walls of an Egyptian tomb was an eye opener. The museum is a bit of a maze--we had to ask to find our way back out. Later, I realized we never made it to the Monet exhibit--hopefully, we'll get a chance to return before we leave. This museum is big and can be overwhelming--I would definitely recommend focusing on specific exhibits that pique your interest--one ticket is good for a second visit within ten days of purchase. Under 17 is free--was getting ready to pay for my daughter at kiosk when museum attendant pointed this out--so accustomed to 17 being adult for most admissions. I would highly recommend this museum.\n",

My eleven year old niece was so engaged. Every time we decided it was time to leave, something else would interest her.

There were not very many people when I was there, so the atmosphere was extremely quiet and peaceful. The only downside was that part of the classical area was closed and roped off. There were some incredibly striking pieces featured at this museum and I would highly recommend that if you are in the area - go. I think it would take more than a day to get through the whole museum - so plan to take your time. It's not really set up for a quick visit. All the staff were friendly, professional and helpful.\n",

The gift shop is terrific. I sometimes go there to buy birthday and holiday gifts. I have never been able to get through the entire museum in one visit - but for me that's true no matter what museum I've been in. Most everything is expensive in Boston, including parking and entry fees - but it's worth it. Depending upon the days you can visit, the museum sometimes has \"free days\" during the week - you might want to call or check that opportunity to save money. If you love good art and beautiful museums - I would highly recommend to go. Enjoy!\n",

      "The Museum Of Fine Arts is easily one of Boston's most stunning attractions. I grew up in Boston and have continuously visited the museum since childhood, and I still feel like I'll never see all of the beautiful pieces this museum has to offer. Because of the wide variety of pieces on display at the MFA, it's extremely difficult to pick my favorite section of the museum. In their permanent collection, I tend to find myself in the Art of the Ancient World and Asia collections most often. The MFA boasts some fascinating and diverse exhibitions. Currently, my three favorites are Showdown! Kuniyoshi vs. Kunisada Follow the North Star; Inuit Art from the Collection of Estrellita and Yousuf Karsh, and Masterpieces of Dutch and Flemish Painting. One of my only critiques is that much like most museums and galleries, the cafÃ© is a little expensive, so if you plan on a full day trip (which I would highly recommend), you might want to pack a lunch. If you're a local, the MFA offers a variety of awesome classes spanning from beginner to advanced levels in a variety of mediums. I am very much enjoying the printmaking class I'm taking, and would definitely recommend considering the MFA if you're interested in learning a new skill, or honing one you already have. The MFA is a must see for locals and tourists alike!\n",

      "I was expecting purely wall art from the Museum of Fine Art in Boston, however I decided to give it a go to fill my day and it ended up being the highlight of my trip ! The museum is a lot bigger then I expected and has a rich collection of art as well as artifacts from all around the world including European Art, American, Ancient and Contemporary. You can also find work of famous artists such as Monet, Picasso and Van Gogh which was very impressive! The ticket is a little pricey ($23 for a student ticket) but it is definitely worth every cent! The ticket is also valid for 10 days and you can re enter as much as you like which is really helpful as the museum is so big you could use a couple visits to truly appreciate it. As I only visited for the day I had to rush my visit but managed to see everything ( I think!) in around 2 and a half hours. The staff is also very helpful ( yes I got lost a few times and needed someone to point me in the right direction) and friendly. They also offer entry discounts if you're a student or senior citizen. I would highly recommend visiting if you're coming to Boston!\n",

We had an opportunity a week later to head back into Boston and the North End was our destination. We had lunch at Restorante Limoncello (same block as Paul Revere's house). Fantastic food, fantastic service! Would highly recommend their signature dish; Rosette Limoncello. Also the Tortelinni - my guess is that everything there is great. From there, we made out way over to Restorante Villa Francesca and had a lovely afternoon sitting at the bar and enjoying a wonderful Lemon Drop Martini. Great atmosphere. Then off to Mike's Pastry. We have never seen a bakery with so many sumptuous goods nor one so crowded; but there was plenty of counter help and we were served within no time. Happily left there with a chocolate chip cannoli and tiramisu - heaven. So many other places to see and eat so will make our way back there some day.\n",

      "An interesting experience. We took the guided tour for $20pp and found ourselves in something of a role play. Every body gets a little card with an historical name on it that you can check out online later if you wish and if you are really lucky? you get one with a quotation that you can expound at the town meeting. The guides are all in costume and truly its quite engaging. The ships of course are mockups but still interesting and the audio visual presentation is really well done. well worth a visit if you are into history which Boston is\n",

The actors were first-rate, and the audience joined in enthusiastically. Unfortunately, the gentle rocking of the barge caused us to leave for dry land before the end, but if you do not suffer from motion sickness the Boston Tea Party Museum is well worth a visit.\n",

It was basically a re-enactment of the Boston Tea Party, starting with a town meeting, followed by a tour of the ship. Inside we were given a tour of the museum, as well as a film. The actors/actresses we encountered were very good. They made the experience unique and fun to learn about. My 14 year old appreciated the humor of the actors and my 10 year old liked being able to throw the tea into the water. All in all, we had a good time and Iâ€™m glad we went. My only wish is that they would have had captions on the movie. In this day and age of accessibility, it seems like a simple accommodation for those who are deaf/hard of hearing or appreciate the information being visually displayed. It is worth a visit here if youâ€™d like a fun place to learn more about the Boston Tea Party.\n",

      "At $30 odd each this isnâ€™t cheap, but the most annoying thing is the ticket price isnâ€™t advertised on the outside of the ticket office so you only find out the cost when you get the the front of the queue; then itâ€™s somehow difficult to say no. Having said that, itâ€™s quite a fun way to learn about the Boston Tea Party and the beginnings of the American revolution. The English donâ€™t come out particularly well so being English it felt a little awkward booing and hissing at ourselves. Well worth a visit but probably worth looking out for some money-off coupons.\n",

The tea room at the end was lovely too. I enjoyed the idea of actually tasting all the teas which were originally aboard the ship, even if I didn't actually enjoy drinking all of them!!

Since it was off season it was easier (I think) to get tickets at the ballpark but they were available online as well. Our tour group was large so once inside they split us up. (PS - you start the tour across the street from park at the store). Our tour consisted of walking along lower deck (able to purchase photo op), stopping by lower part of green monster with a brief history, upstairs to upper deck and seats above the green monster, up again to the press box and then down and around first base side to outfield. The history that ballpark has is quite interesting and itâ€™s set-up with capacity also surprised me (my home ballpark is PNC Park). This was worth the ~$20 ticket. I wish (and maybe there is) an upgraded option to visit the dugouts and go into field.\n",

You most definitely need Excellent WALKING shoes to safely maneuver the cobblestones, cracked/uneven sidewalks, and construction areas in the 2.5 mile trail---Keep in mind that there are hills for anyone with ambulatory or respiratory problems. We followed the trail (red bricks/red lines in the sidewalk), stopping at all the 16 historical sights listed (online or pick up an official brochure found in numerous locations and visitors center with lots of information). We took time to read displays, take in the historical significance, took pictures, listened to sight presentations and asked questions. Some sights are free, few request donations, few have admission costs (with discounts for students, seniors, veterans, etc.). Keep in mind that at the USS Constitution you need to show ID and also to go thru their security checkpoint. All of the sights were well staffed with knowledgeable members and were worth the time we spent. Restrooms at some, but not all sights. We certainly appreciated experiencing this American trail of history in person.\n",

Because of road improvements many of the red markings have disappeared and you are then left to guess or ask for assistance to the next location Please make it easier .

      "Follow the â€œYellow Brick Roadâ€ or in this case the Red Brick Line also known as the Freedom Trail. This red brick line takes you on a 2.5 mile walk past Bostonâ€™s revolutioniary historic sites. Starting at Boston Common and ending at Bunker Hill Monument you pass the Massachusetts State House, Faneuil Hall, Paul Revere House and plenty more with a side trip to the USS Constitution. All well worth visits in their own right. It is possible to have a guided tour on the Freedom Trail however we think better to go at your own speed with a guide book! It is very easy to follow, (see photographs) but do remember to look up and around you not just down at the trail that you are following!\n",

      "Using the Freedom Trail App, we really enjoyed traipsing through Boston on this trail. It's easy to find even without the app, but a local map is nice. There are great museums along the way and although they require a fee (8.50/adult), they are well worth the fee. The only place we couldn't get was the Paul Revere statue because of construction. What's great about this 'trail' is that you go at your own pace, stopping to see those attractions that are more of interest to your group. We stopped at Mike's for cannoli (a bit off the trail) and had a quick bite at Quincy Market (something for everyone) and visited just about every site along the trail. It took most of the day but it was very nice. Our day was cold and a bit windy but still nice to walk around. One of the most interesting sites was the cemetery at the start, and also Copps Hill burying ground. Tons of history all along the way - a great introduction to Boston and the Revolutionary War period. By the end of our day, with a few detours, my daughter's watch said 15,000 steps. Wear comfortable shoes!\n",

Stpo here to see some of the most impressive Copley and Sargent paintings. The world jewelry and musical instrument exhibits are small but very educational. The MFA staff was very helpful in resetting our bearings in such a large museum and the food stops were both reasonable and healthy. The price is a bit high for anyone wanting to go often (as it is a large endeavour), but for a one day stop it well worth the time.\n",

      "I try to visit at least one museum on every business trip I take. Not only to feast my eyes on the collections - I also usually find the best gifts, for a year's worth of giving ,in the museum gift shops - where else can you get samples of the artists, European made toys and specialty gifts, as well as designer jewelry and textiles? Boston MOFA did not disappoint from my very first conversation with a 'page' who asked me what I wanted to see and in what order and promptly 'customized' my museum map accordingly. I started in the 'cafe' really an open air indoor courtyard with beautiful natural light, soothing music and a floor to ceiling Chihuly glass flora sculpture to admire. I sat at the bar and feasted my eyes on the scrumptious offerings served on my left and right, then feasted my taste buds on the piping hot mussels spotted on the menu. And there they came, complete with a slurp-til-the-end broth and crispy toast to dip it in. Delicious with a glass of Pinot Gris. Meandering my way through well lit and diverse galleries of the impressionists, mid-century furniture and tableware, which was fascinating - sculpture -glass, metal and basalt -I especially enjoyed the 'Boston School' collection, as I recognized some of the names but had not seen such a comprehensive collection of portraiture and lovely landscapes in one setting. Last stop in the museum gift shop yielded unique gifts for all the lovelies in my family next Christmas. MOFA deserves at least two more afternoons - in my book - and hope to visit again.\n",

It is crowded and the businesses are definitely close to (on top of) each other, but it is worth a visit, if you like Italian food and treats. We passed tons of Italian and seafood restaurants, as well as delis. We also saw several gelato places! After our long walk, we stopped at CafÃ© Vittoria for some gelato. It was tasty, but be mindful that lots of places in North End are cash-only!!

       "'My wife and I were on a trip to Boston sightseeing and was looking forward to visiting this attraction. We paid $59 for both of us and of all the things that we did on our three week trip to New England this was by far the biggest waste of money. The tour starts in a mock up of the Old Meeting house and is conducted by two role playing guides. The whole presentation is aimed at young children - probably 5 to 10 year olds - fair enough but we hoped we would be able to read the info in the exhibits. However, the issue is that everything is rushed and the very few things to read/look at that are in the \"museum\" you are not given time to take in. When we went out to the boat the guide gave his talk on the top deck and then asked everybody to go down to the next deck where he would continue the tour. There were two sets of stairs going down but we were told we could only use one. We were at the back of a large group, thirty or forty people, and by the time we had filed downstairs the guide was already half way through his talk so we missed it (no waiting allowed as they have to clear the room for the next group). After the talk the group were very quickly led around the lower deck in single file and back up the other stairs - no time to really look at anything. We then went on the quayside for another short discourse from the guide where there were some poster exhibits to read. However, by the time we filed off the boat at the back of the group we were told to move on and did not have time to read any of the exhibits. This happened throughout the rest of the \"tour\". The whole thing lasted less than an hour and was a total waste of time and money! Give this a miss - your time is much better spent exploring many of the other excellent attractions in Boston especially the Navy Dockyard where you get as much time as you want to spend on two real boats!'"

We got much more than just here sis building and here's what happened we got social and political insights along with wonderful anecdotal stories I had not heard before. The tour began at Boston Common and in it at Faneuil Hall, taking about 90 minutes. Our guide was quite knowledgeable, and encouraged questions as we went along.

       "20201  What a brilliant idea. In the 50s Boston created a red brick trail linking the citie's historic sites. You can easily follow the trail yourself, there's an app for that. I highly recommend the docent guided my guide really made history come alive. We got much more than just here sis building and here's what happened we got social and political insights along with wonderful anecdotal stories I had not heard before. The tour began at Boston Common and in it at Faneuil Hall, taking about 90 minutes. Our guide was quite knowledgeable, and encouraged questions as we went along. I loved every minute and I would do it again?   \n",

The web site is really Well made. You can also take Ã  guided tour. We really liked the cemetery, public garden, Boston massacre site and state house.   \n",

I was very naÃ¯ve with regards the Boston Tea Party but after this I felt that it was very informative and I've learned lot and it was very entertaining. Also the tea room at the end is lovely, make sure you sample the tea!   \n",

We both thoroughly enjoyed this tour. The history is neat and the ballpark is fantastic. The way it has been preserved and maintained is wonderful. This tour is primarily focused on Fenway history. You tour the green monster seats, sit in the media area, oldest seats in the stadium and ended with a great room of memorabilia. We plan to go back for the Game Day tour. Even if you arenâ€™t a huge baseball fan you will enjoy this tour!!   \n",

My dad wanted to check it out so we went there. It's nice and we even got to see the Red Sox practicing before a game which made it very nice. Would definitely recommend checking it out if you're in Boston.   \n",

It was a great way to see and learn about the history around the revolution and the beginning of the United States in an interactive physical manner. We started in Boston Common and followed the Clearly designed red line that directs you along all the way to the Old North Church and the Paul Revere Statue. Along the way we were able to stop and see the different buildings and monuments. We stopped at McDonald's for lunch and just enjoyed the walk around town.   \n",

The staff were dressed in historically appropriate attire and kids would probably really get a kick out of doing this. We checked out the gift shop too, but overall it just wasn't my 'cup of tea'. We did walk close by to a waterfront seafood restaurant that was great but when the rain picked up it was a chilly (yummy) meal under their tent.</td>\n",

       "      <td>I visited here during a one week visit to Boston. It is a lovely museum, very impressive from the outside, and there are a number of places to eat and drink in the museum. It is well located for public transport although I walked down from Kenmore square. The very disappointing thing about this museum were the large number of regular areas that were closed. Not only was it disappointing that the galleries were closed, but it also meant, that as someone who has mobility problems, I found it difficult to find a lift that I could use that did not end up in a dead end. There were some exhibits closed that I really wanted to see. The other disappointment was the very large number of school parties that were visiting. This meant that moving around the museum was challenging because being young people they were not aware of anything outside their world, including people trying to get through the corridors that they were spread across. The museum acoustics were also quite poor, so the children shrieking at each other was amplified. There seemed to be no attempts to keep their voices down a little so as not to interrupt the enjoyment of other visitors. It was a Friday in February, and maybe this is a day to avoid. Or the museum could try and regulate school visits so that they are more spread out across the week?</td>\n",

It is a lot of walking so be sure to wear comfortable shoes! I was glad we did not make a reservation in advance as we had problems getting to Boston from the train and took us longer than expected so we would of missed our time so by us doing self guided tour it worked out fine. We started at what we thought was the Boston Common, but some how didn't start where we wanted to so had to do some back tracking. We saw what you would of seen if you did the \"Walk into History\" and \"North End\" tours. It was nice as we could go at our own pace and take a lot of pictures. If I did it again the next time I would do a guided tour so I got a little more history and understood what I was looking at without having to google it on my phone.</td>\n",

It does not meet or depart from Lansdowne and I absolutely don't understand why that appears in the write up. In order to pick up your ticket you have to go to gate D which is on Jersey Street. This does appear in the booking details but is mishmashed with some other useless information about and/or main ticket office. Google maps was pretty much useless here. We noticed several other groups looking for the pickup location. We tried calling the number in the listing for help in locating the correct ticket pickup location but got an answering machine.

But if your visit runs past 6:00 PM, you will get a $40 parking ticket. There is one sign at each end of the block that says the spaces are \"restricted to residents\" after 6:00 PM. No sticker on the meter, no other signs between the ends of the block. The museum? That is fine. But evidently they haven't complained to the city of Boston about the predatory parking situation next to them.   \n",

There were people participating in the tea party, by throwing large square 'bales of tea' overboard. I believe they paid to go onboard to tour the real looking ship and participate in the revolution. The staff were dressed in historically appropriate attire and kids would probably really get a kick out of doing this. We checked out the gift shop too, but overall it just wasn't my 'cup of tea'. We did walk close by to a waterfront seafood restaurant that was great but when the rain picked up it was a chilly (yummy) meal under their tent.   \n",

       "22565  I visited here during a one week visit to Boston. It is a lovely museum, very impressive from the outside, and there are a number of places to eat and drink in the museum. It is well located for public transport although I walked down from Kenmore square. The very disappointing thing about this museum were the large number of regular areas that were closed. Not only was it disappointing that the galleries were closed, but it also meant, that as someone who has mobility problems, I found it difficult to find a lift that I could use that did not end up in a dead end. There were some exhibits closed that I really wanted to see. The other disappointment was the very large number of school parties that were visiting. This meant that moving around the museum was challenging because being young people they were not aware of anything outside their world, including people trying to get through the corridors that they were spread across. The museum acoustics were also quite poor, so the children shrieking at each other was amplified. There seemed to be no attempts to keep their voices down a little so as not to interrupt the enjoyment of other visitors. It was a Friday in February, and maybe this is a day to avoid. Or the museum could try and regulate school visits so that they are more spread out across the week?   \n",

I was glad we did not make a reservation in advance as we had problems getting to Boston from the train and took us longer than expected so we would of missed our time so by us doing self guided tour it worked out fine. We started at what we thought was the Boston Common, but some how didn't start where we wanted to so had to do some back tracking. We saw what you would of seen if you did the \"Walk into History\" and \"North End\" tours. It was nice as we could go at our own pace and take a lot of pictures. If I did it again the next time I would do a guided tour so I got a little more history and understood what I was looking at without having to google it on my phone.   \n",

The only thing that could have made it better was a visit to the dugouts. The issue with the information provided on tripadvisor and with this tour provider is the incompleteness and confusion. The tour departure location is in the write up is just plain wrong. It does not meet or depart from Lansdowne and I absolutely don't understand why that appears in the write up. In order to pick up your ticket you have to go to gate D which is on Jersey Street. This does appear in the booking details but is mishmashed with some other useless information about and/or main ticket office. Google maps was pretty much useless here. We noticed several other groups looking for the pickup location. We tried calling the number in the listing for help in locating the correct ticket pickup location but got an answering machine. We a message and callback information but received no callback. The tour provider and tripadvisor have some work to do to tidy this up.   \n",

       "\"Sorry guys but we really didn't like this museum. The role play by actors in costumes was frankly embarrassing (British reserve I guess) and so little history about what actually happened and its significance. We all found the shouty actors irritating after a while, and the one exhibit in the museum just made us laugh - a tea chest on a rotating podium with spotlights, behind glass. Really? The crown jewels in the Tower of London have less fanfare than that. The film was really good though (no shouting) but the talking portraits were frankly silly. The portrayal of King George was laughable and comedic - not suitable for a historic museum and a bit insulting I thought (although understandable given the context I guess). Sorry guys, this place is clearly aimed at a domestic audience and to be fair the US visitors seemed to love it. However we just didn't enjoy it and the whole experience left us cold and irritable. Great gift shop though with the best selection we saw anywhere in Boston, so not a complete letdown :-)\""

Great audience participation with the live period dress characters. We had a great time even though it was raining. This is an excellent attraction and I would recommend a visit. A good tip is to pre book Boston Trolly Bus tickets and there is the opportunity to visit the Boston Tea Party Ships and Museam for free.   \n",

       "      <td>My spouse and I visited Bostonâ€™s Museum of Fine Arts (MFA) on a Saturday afternoon in late May 2017. The museum is open daily from approximately 10:00 am until 5:00 pm, with extended hours until 10:00 pm on Wednesdays (including â€œWinedaysâ€ social event), Thursdays, and Fridays (including the monthly reoccurring â€œFirst Fridayâ€ cocktail party). Be sure to check their website for exact details. Admission costs $25 per adult, but you can enjoy a repeat visit within 10 days. If you visit the neighboring Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum (ISGM), you can save $2 on a combined admission. You are requested to check larger bags at the coat check counter. The over 600,000-square foot museum (founded in 1870) opened in its present Fenway-Kenmore neighborhood location in the early 1900s. The museum seems to occupy a series of interconnected buildings and wings (which makes navigating around a bit tricky). The museum collection is displayed in over 30 spacious, high-ceilinged galleries spread over four floors (including the basement). You can use either stairs or elevators to travel between the levels. Several dining options are available, including Bravo, American CafÃ©, Taste, and the Garden Cafeteria (listed in descending order from most formal/expensive to least). The expansive glass-enclosed courtyard hosts one of my favorite pieces in the museum, Dale Chihulyâ€™s 42-foot-high lime green icicle tower. Another favorite space is the rotunda with colonnades and frescoes painted by John Singer Sargent. (We loved how the museum placed a mirror in the center of the first floor space so that you can view the reflected ceiling paintings without craning your neck - an interesting technique that we had not seen before!) The architecture of the museum itself is almost as interesting as the objects that hang inside it. The MFA's vast and varied collection of approximately 450,000 objects includes works by American painters (Homer, Sargent, Hopper, and Cassatt), Impressionists (Monet, Manet, Renoir, Degas, Van Gogh, Cezanne), sculptures, furniture, Egyptian artifacts, Asian art from Japan and China, African masks, Native American pottery, and contemporary art. At any one time, the museum offers many rotating temporary exhibitions by a variety of artists. When we visited, the current exhibitions featured Botticelli, Matisse, Robert McCloskey (of â€œMake Way for Duckingsâ€ fame), Polish ghetto photographs, and jewelry (including pieces by Tiffany, Cartier, and Bulgari). We enjoyed our visit to the Museum of Fine Arts â€“ the building is beautiful, the permanent collection is excellent, and the rotating exhibitions are interesting.</td>\n",

Hereâ€™s the thing â€“ you donâ€™t have to do this walk in one hit â€“ it can easily be divided into 3: 1 â€“ the stuff at and close to BOSTON COMMON** out to and including BOSTON PUBLIC MARKET**. 2 â€“ the rest of the south of the CHARLES RIVER attractions 3 â€“ the 2 attractions north of the CHARLES. Or less if you are really time-short. I will leave it to you to check the 3 zones and their attractions on the many online sites and figure out what works for you. I initially decided to split the walk in two â€“ zones 1+ 2 combined and then check out the over-river places sometime later. But as my hero JOHN MEYNARD KEYNES said: â€œwhen the facts change, I change my mindâ€. The facts in my case were I was enjoying the trail much more than initially thought and despite my 74yo arthritic knees crying â€œRESTâ€, I was in reality far from quitting â€“ so I charged (um- actually limped) across the NORTH WASHINGTON ST BRIDGE over the CHARLES and spent the next hour or so checking out the USS CONSTITUTION** area + the BUNKER HILL MONUMENT**. TIPS â€“ spend a bit of time in the VISITORSâ€™ CENTER in BOSTON COMMON** at the start of the trail â€“ lotsa good info here including maps/notes of the trail. - they say you can knock over the trail in 2 hours but time consuming things like BOSTON PUBLIC MARKETS**, USS CONSTITUTION** and BUNKER HILL MONUMENT** could easily add and hour+ EACH. Perhaps more. - be prepared for the USS CONSTITUTION**/USS CASSEIN YOUNG** (Fletcher class destroyer) at the CHARLSTOWN NAVAL SHIPYARD**, This area is under navel jurisdiction and has those airport-type baggage checks at entry (including the museum). Because I had a drink bottle over the mandatory 100ml and because these security checks to me are getting a bit onerous, I gave these areas the big miss. Actually there is plenty to see from the outside. The good news is that the BUNKER HILL MONUMENT (administered by the NATIONAL PARK SERVICE) had no such nonsense. - getting back to the central city seemed an easy, relatively straight shot to me, but I must admit I got a bit lost. Do yer research. SUM UP â€“ online guides say you can knock the full walk over in 2 hours â€“ but spending the time some of the stops justify could see you using much of the day. A good one. ** Tripadvisor has user reviews pages on all.</td>\n",

You can take this tour and finish with very little idea of what the event was, what led up to it, or why it turned out to be significant. The only thought that seeps through is that if you are angry over an insignificant tax, it is ok to destroy other people's property. An actress of limited ability plays the role of an actual participant, and conducts the tour, which is not really a museum visit but a replica ship and then a series of rooms with videos.

But, boy, are we glad we went there ! What a great surprise to find such a huge collection of Dutch Golden Age and French impressionists ! Being European tourists, that's where we spent all of our time ; but we learned later that the American Art displays are even more impressive. So much splendid art, so little time . . . next time, for sure.   \n",

The Matisse exhibit was interesting as the you can see the works with the objects of inspiration including a pewter jug, a chocolate maker, an Andalusian vase, textiles, sculptures and masks.   \n",

We walked it several times on our way from Boston Common to a restaurant around Faneuil Hall. Then finally we bought tickets for the guided tour from the kiosk in Boston Common and joined a small group of about 8 people. The tour guide was most informative and entertaining : at $ 12 per person it is a small investment to learn heaps about an important period of Boston's (and America's !) history in a fun way.   \n",

The weather was ok and it wasnâ€™t that crowded. Itâ€™s a great old park that is full of character and they embrace the past. Itâ€™s a great place to go.

       "21284  My spouse and I visited Bostonâ€™s Museum of Fine Arts (MFA) on a Saturday afternoon in late May 2017. The museum is open daily from approximately 10:00 am until 5:00 pm, with extended hours until 10:00 pm on Wednesdays (including â€œWinedaysâ€ social event), Thursdays, and Fridays (including the monthly reoccurring â€œFirst Fridayâ€ cocktail party). Be sure to check their website for exact details. Admission costs $25 per adult, but you can enjoy a repeat visit within 10 days. If you visit the neighboring Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum (ISGM), you can save $2 on a combined admission. You are requested to check larger bags at the coat check counter. The over 600,000-square foot museum (founded in 1870) opened in its present Fenway-Kenmore neighborhood location in the early 1900s. The museum seems to occupy a series of interconnected buildings and wings (which makes navigating around a bit tricky). The museum collection is displayed in over 30 spacious, high-ceilinged galleries spread over four floors (including the basement). You can use either stairs or elevators to travel between the levels. Several dining options are available, including Bravo, American CafÃ©, Taste, and the Garden Cafeteria (listed in descending order from most formal/expensive to least). The expansive glass-enclosed courtyard hosts one of my favorite pieces in the museum, Dale Chihulyâ€™s 42-foot-high lime green icicle tower. Another favorite space is the rotunda with colonnades and frescoes painted by John Singer Sargent. (We loved how the museum placed a mirror in the center of the first floor space so that you can view the reflected ceiling paintings without craning your neck - an interesting technique that we had not seen before!) The architecture of the museum itself is almost as interesting as the objects that hang inside it. The MFA's vast and varied collection of approximately 450,000 objects includes works by American painters (Homer, Sargent, Hopper, and Cassatt), Impressionists (Monet, Manet, Renoir, Degas, Van Gogh, Cezanne), sculptures, furniture, Egyptian artifacts, Asian art from Japan and China, African masks, Native American pottery, and contemporary art. At any one time, the museum offers many rotating temporary exhibitions by a variety of artists. When we visited, the current exhibitions featured Botticelli, Matisse, Robert McCloskey (of â€œMake Way for Duckingsâ€ fame), Polish ghetto photographs, and jewelry (including pieces by Tiffany, Cartier, and Bulgari). We enjoyed our visit to the Museum of Fine Arts â€“ the building is beautiful, the permanent collection is excellent, and the rotating exhibitions are interesting.   \n",

But the permanent collection is very strong, especially in American art and the Impressionists. Lovely place to spend an afternoon -- beautifully curated and nicely separated collections.   \n",

You can walk at your leisure as there is literally a line in the ground to guide you. I'd probably recommend a small group walking tour or a good guide book to learn as much as possible.   \n",

Hereâ€™s the thing â€“ you donâ€™t have to do this walk in one hit â€“ it can easily be divided into 3: 1 â€“ the stuff at and close to BOSTON COMMON** out to and including BOSTON PUBLIC MARKET**. 2 â€“ the rest of the south of the CHARLES RIVER attractions 3 â€“ the 2 attractions north of the CHARLES. Or less if you are really time-short. I will leave it to you to check the 3 zones and their attractions on the many online sites and figure out what works for you. I initially decided to split the walk in two â€“ zones 1+ 2 combined and then check out the over-river places sometime later. But as my hero JOHN MEYNARD KEYNES said: â€œwhen the facts change, I change my mindâ€. The facts in my case were I was enjoying the trail much more than initially thought and despite my 74yo arthritic knees crying â€œRESTâ€, I was in reality far from quitting â€“ so I charged (um- actually limped) across the NORTH WASHINGTON ST BRIDGE over the CHARLES and spent the next hour or so checking out the USS CONSTITUTION** area + the BUNKER HILL MONUMENT**. TIPS â€“ spend a bit of time in the VISITORSâ€™ CENTER in BOSTON COMMON** at the start of the trail â€“ lotsa good info here including maps/notes of the trail. - they say you can knock over the trail in 2 hours but time consuming things like BOSTON PUBLIC MARKETS**, USS CONSTITUTION** and BUNKER HILL MONUMENT** could easily add and hour+ EACH. Perhaps more. - be prepared for the USS CONSTITUTION**/USS CASSEIN YOUNG** (Fletcher class destroyer) at the CHARLSTOWN NAVAL SHIPYARD**, This area is under navel jurisdiction and has those airport-type baggage checks at entry (including the museum). Because I had a drink bottle over the mandatory 100ml and because these security checks to me are getting a bit onerous, I gave these areas the big miss. Actually there is plenty to see from the outside. The good news is that the BUNKER HILL MONUMENT (administered by the NATIONAL PARK SERVICE) had no such nonsense. - getting back to the central city seemed an easy, relatively straight shot to me, but I must admit I got a bit lost. Do yer research. SUM UP â€“ online guides say you can knock the full walk over in 2 hours â€“ but spending the time some of the stops justify could see you using much of the day. A good one. ** Tripadvisor has user reviews pages on all.   \n",

Parking is a bit of a challenge but once that is done (nice lot across from the skating rink) it is fun to just roam around and see where you end up. I always am looking for a good meal and there are dozens of places to choose from. There are also dessert places and places just for a drink. If you are budget minded there a good places for pizza. The Old North Church is in the middle of the North End and a lovely statue of Paul Revere. Spend a couple of hours strolling around here. A must do for visitors of Boston   \n",

You can take this tour and finish with very little idea of what the event was, what led up to it, or why it turned out to be significant. The only thought that seeps through is that if you are angry over an insignificant tax, it is ok to destroy other people's property. An actress of limited ability plays the role of an actual participant, and conducts the tour, which is not really a museum visit but a replica ship and then a series of rooms with videos. At over $25 a head, this is not a good way to spend your tourist dollar.   \n",

But, boy, are we glad we went there ! What a great surprise to find such a huge collection of Dutch Golden Age and French impressionists ! Being European tourists, that's where we spent all of our time ; but we learned later that the American Art displays are even more impressive.

       "      <td>My spouse and I visited Bostonâ€™s Museum of Fine Arts (MFA) on a Saturday afternoon in late May 2017. The museum is open daily from approximately 10:00 am until 5:00 pm, with extended hours until 10:00 pm on Wednesdays (including â€œWinedaysâ€ social event), Thursdays, and Fridays (including the monthly reoccurring â€œFirst Fridayâ€ cocktail party). Be sure to check their website for exact details. Admission costs $25 per adult, but you can enjoy a repeat visit within 10 days. If you visit the neighboring Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum (ISGM), you can save $2 on a combined admission. You are requested to check larger bags at the coat check counter. The over 600,000-square foot museum (founded in 1870) opened in its present Fenway-Kenmore neighborhood location in the early 1900s. The museum seems to occupy a series of interconnected buildings and wings (which makes navigating around a bit tricky). The museum collection is displayed in over 30 spacious, high-ceilinged galleries spread over four floors (including the basement). You can use either stairs or elevators to travel between the levels. Several dining options are available, including Bravo, American CafÃ©, Taste, and the Garden Cafeteria (listed in descending order from most formal/expensive to least). The expansive glass-enclosed courtyard hosts one of my favorite pieces in the museum, Dale Chihulyâ€™s 42-foot-high lime green icicle tower. Another favorite space is the rotunda with colonnades and frescoes painted by John Singer Sargent. (We loved how the museum placed a mirror in the center of the first floor space so that you can view the reflected ceiling paintings without craning your neck - an interesting technique that we had not seen before!) The architecture of the museum itself is almost as interesting as the objects that hang inside it. The MFA's vast and varied collection of approximately 450,000 objects includes works by American painters (Homer, Sargent, Hopper, and Cassatt), Impressionists (Monet, Manet, Renoir, Degas, Van Gogh, Cezanne), sculptures, furniture, Egyptian artifacts, Asian art from Japan and China, African masks, Native American pottery, and contemporary art. At any one time, the museum offers many rotating temporary exhibitions by a variety of artists. When we visited, the current exhibitions featured Botticelli, Matisse, Robert McCloskey (of â€œMake Way for Duckingsâ€ fame), Polish ghetto photographs, and jewelry (including pieces by Tiffany, Cartier, and Bulgari). We enjoyed our visit to the Museum of Fine Arts â€“ the building is beautiful, the permanent collection is excellent, and the rotating exhibitions are interesting.</td>\n",

       "      <td>â€¦.I FOUND IT SO INTERESTING, I KNOCKED IT OVER IN ONE GO. Hereâ€™s the thing â€“ you donâ€™t have to do this walk in one hit â€“ it can easily be divided into 3: 1 â€“ the stuff at and close to BOSTON COMMON** out to and including BOSTON PUBLIC MARKET**. 2 â€“ the rest of the south of the CHARLES RIVER attractions 3 â€“ the 2 attractions north of the CHARLES. Or less if you are really time-short. I will leave it to you to check the 3 zones and their attractions on the many online sites and figure out what works for you. I initially decided to split the walk in two â€“ zones 1+ 2 combined and then check out the over-river places sometime later. But as my hero JOHN MEYNARD KEYNES said: â€œwhen the facts change, I change my mindâ€. The facts in my case were I was enjoying the trail much more than initially thought and despite my 74yo arthritic knees crying â€œRESTâ€, I was in reality far from quitting â€“ so I charged (um- actually limped) across the NORTH WASHINGTON ST BRIDGE over the CHARLES and spent the next hour or so checking out the USS CONSTITUTION** area + the BUNKER HILL MONUMENT**. TIPS â€“ spend a bit of time in the VISITORSâ€™ CENTER in BOSTON COMMON** at the start of the trail â€“ lotsa good info here including maps/notes of the trail. - they say you can knock over the trail in 2 hours but time consuming things like BOSTON PUBLIC MARKETS**, USS CONSTITUTION** and BUNKER HILL MONUMENT** could easily add and hour+ EACH. Perhaps more. - be prepared for the USS CONSTITUTION**/USS CASSEIN YOUNG** (Fletcher class destroyer) at the CHARLSTOWN NAVAL SHIPYARD**, This area is under navel jurisdiction and has those airport-type baggage checks at entry (including the museum). Because I had a drink bottle over the mandatory 100ml and because these security checks to me are getting a bit onerous, I gave these areas the big miss. Actually there is plenty to see from the outside. The good news is that the BUNKER HILL MONUMENT (administered by the NATIONAL PARK SERVICE) had no such nonsense. - getting back to the central city seemed an easy, relatively straight shot to me, but I must admit I got a bit lost. Do yer research. SUM UP â€“ online guides say you can knock the full walk over in 2 hours â€“ but spending the time some of the stops justify could see you using much of the day. A good one. ** Tripadvisor has user reviews pages on all.</td>\n",

But, boy, are we glad we went there ! What a great surprise to find such a huge collection of Dutch Golden Age and French impressionists ! Being European tourists, that's where we spent all of our time ; but we learned later that the American Art displays are even more impressive. So much splendid art, so little time . . . next time, for sure.  \n",

The Matisse exhibit was interesting as the you can see the works with the objects of inspiration including a pewter jug, a chocolate maker, an Andalusian vase, textiles, sculptures and masks.  \n",

We walked it several times on our way from Boston Common to a restaurant around Faneuil Hall. Then finally we bought tickets for the guided tour from the kiosk in Boston Common and joined a small group of about 8 people. The tour guide was most informative and entertaining : at $ 12 per person it is a small investment to learn heaps about an important period of Boston's (and America's !) history in a fun way.  \n",

The weather was ok and it wasnâ€™t that crowded. Itâ€™s a great old park that is full of character and they embrace the past. Itâ€™s a great place to go.

       "21284  My spouse and I visited Bostonâ€™s Museum of Fine Arts (MFA) on a Saturday afternoon in late May 2017. The museum is open daily from approximately 10:00 am until 5:00 pm, with extended hours until 10:00 pm on Wednesdays (including â€œWinedaysâ€ social event), Thursdays, and Fridays (including the monthly reoccurring â€œFirst Fridayâ€ cocktail party). Be sure to check their website for exact details. Admission costs $25 per adult, but you can enjoy a repeat visit within 10 days. If you visit the neighboring Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum (ISGM), you can save $2 on a combined admission. You are requested to check larger bags at the coat check counter. The over 600,000-square foot museum (founded in 1870) opened in its present Fenway-Kenmore neighborhood location in the early 1900s. The museum seems to occupy a series of interconnected buildings and wings (which makes navigating around a bit tricky). The museum collection is displayed in over 30 spacious, high-ceilinged galleries spread over four floors (including the basement). You can use either stairs or elevators to travel between the levels. Several dining options are available, including Bravo, American CafÃ©, Taste, and the Garden Cafeteria (listed in descending order from most formal/expensive to least). The expansive glass-enclosed courtyard hosts one of my favorite pieces in the museum, Dale Chihulyâ€™s 42-foot-high lime green icicle tower. Another favorite space is the rotunda with colonnades and frescoes painted by John Singer Sargent. (We loved how the museum placed a mirror in the center of the first floor space so that you can view the reflected ceiling paintings without craning your neck - an interesting technique that we had not seen before!) The architecture of the museum itself is almost as interesting as the objects that hang inside it. The MFA's vast and varied collection of approximately 450,000 objects includes works by American painters (Homer, Sargent, Hopper, and Cassatt), Impressionists (Monet, Manet, Renoir, Degas, Van Gogh, Cezanne), sculptures, furniture, Egyptian artifacts, Asian art from Japan and China, African masks, Native American pottery, and contemporary art. At any one time, the museum offers many rotating temporary exhibitions by a variety of artists. When we visited, the current exhibitions featured Botticelli, Matisse, Robert McCloskey (of â€œMake Way for Duckingsâ€ fame), Polish ghetto photographs, and jewelry (including pieces by Tiffany, Cartier, and Bulgari). We enjoyed our visit to the Museum of Fine Arts â€“ the building is beautiful, the permanent collection is excellent, and the rotating exhibitions are interesting.  \n",

But the permanent collection is very strong, especially in American art and the Impressionists. Lovely place to spend an afternoon -- beautifully curated and nicely separated collections.  \n",

You can walk at your leisure as there is literally a line in the ground to guide you. I'd probably recommend a small group walking tour or a good guide book to learn as much as possible.  \n",

Hereâ€™s the thing â€“ you donâ€™t have to do this walk in one hit â€“ it can easily be divided into 3: 1 â€“ the stuff at and close to BOSTON COMMON** out to and including BOSTON PUBLIC MARKET**. 2 â€“ the rest of the south of the CHARLES RIVER attractions 3 â€“ the 2 attractions north of the CHARLES. Or less if you are really time-short. I will leave it to you to check the 3 zones and their attractions on the many online sites and figure out what works for you. I initially decided to split the walk in two â€“ zones 1+ 2 combined and then check out the over-river places sometime later. But as my hero JOHN MEYNARD KEYNES said: â€œwhen the facts change, I change my mindâ€. The facts in my case were I was enjoying the trail much more than initially thought and despite my 74yo arthritic knees crying â€œRESTâ€, I was in reality far from quitting â€“ so I charged (um- actually limped) across the NORTH WASHINGTON ST BRIDGE over the CHARLES and spent the next hour or so checking out the USS CONSTITUTION** area + the BUNKER HILL MONUMENT**. TIPS â€“ spend a bit of time in the VISITORSâ€™ CENTER in BOSTON COMMON** at the start of the trail â€“ lotsa good info here including maps/notes of the trail. - they say you can knock over the trail in 2 hours but time consuming things like BOSTON PUBLIC MARKETS**, USS CONSTITUTION** and BUNKER HILL MONUMENT** could easily add and hour+ EACH. Perhaps more. - be prepared for the USS CONSTITUTION**/USS CASSEIN YOUNG** (Fletcher class destroyer) at the CHARLSTOWN NAVAL SHIPYARD**, This area is under navel jurisdiction and has those airport-type baggage checks at entry (including the museum). Because I had a drink bottle over the mandatory 100ml and because these security checks to me are getting a bit onerous, I gave these areas the big miss. Actually there is plenty to see from the outside. The good news is that the BUNKER HILL MONUMENT (administered by the NATIONAL PARK SERVICE) had no such nonsense. - getting back to the central city seemed an easy, relatively straight shot to me, but I must admit I got a bit lost. Do yer research. SUM UP â€“ online guides say you can knock the full walk over in 2 hours â€“ but spending the time some of the stops justify could see you using much of the day. A good one. ** Tripadvisor has user reviews pages on all.  \n",

Parking is a bit of a challenge but once that is done (nice lot across from the skating rink) it is fun to just roam around and see where you end up. I always am looking for a good meal and there are dozens of places to choose from. There are also dessert places and places just for a drink. If you are budget minded there a good places for pizza. The Old North Church is in the middle of the North End and a lovely statue of Paul Revere. Spend a couple of hours strolling around here. A must do for visitors of Boston  \n",

You can take this tour and finish with very little idea of what the event was, what led up to it, or why it turned out to be significant. The only thought that seeps through is that if you are angry over an insignificant tax, it is ok to destroy other people's property. An actress of limited ability plays the role of an actual participant, and conducts the tour, which is not really a museum visit but a replica ship and then a series of rooms with videos. At over $25 a head, this is not a good way to spend your tourist dollar.  \n",

There is a bit of everything here, much like New York's Met but more manageable in size. We especially liked the American Revolutionary era paintings and American Impressionists. The central atrium houses an upscale cafe.  \n",

Being European tourists, that's where we spent all of our time ; but we learned later that the American Art displays are even more impressive.

They have a superb collection, and we had a great time wandering through their halls.

We planned to have about 3 hours there, and we found that we ran out of time! It is a museum that has something to appeal to everyone!   \n",

The tour takes you to all places round the ground including the Green Monster and press box and the tour guides are both knowledgeable and full of fun stories. The entrance fee of $21 is worth it for the history and the ability to say that 'I have been there'. definitely put it on your itinerary. One note, if you go during the winter there is limited refreshment stops around the ground.   \n",

He was able to engage my 10 year old and keep him interested in what he would learn next. He found this to be very educational and enjoyable. Thank you for an exceptional walking tour!   \n",

       "34593  Outside the main entrance is a striking sculpture of and Indian Chief. Inside we started in the European section which is on three floors. There was a great deal to enjoy but especially the Impressionists section and most especially Signac Port of Sant-Cast, Monet Haystack in the snow and a stunning painting by Theodore van Rysselberghe Belgian The Regatta 1892. The American section was also interesting and I enjoyed the Wilmslow Homer and John Singer Sergeant and Whistler paintings. The main atrium is very impressive with a superb giant Green Thistle superb. We took a break at Taste CafÃ© and went on to the special exhibitions. If I lived in Boston I would definitely become a member so as to visit here often. There is so much to see and enjoy.   \n",

We spent time on the field, were then ushered to sit down, the guide said that there was no time to talk about the history of the park (because the warm-up music started) but if you have questions to ask him. Then up to the Green Monster where we watched batting practice - and the tour was over. Are you kidding me?? The last time we took a group tour which was fun and informative - and you could buy tickets online. For this I had to go the the park earlier in the day to get the tickets?

Our tour guide originally said they were going to split is into two groups because our group was so large but that didn't happen. So that means if you are stuck in the back of the group it is hard to hear and also was a problem when we went to sit up on the green monster and there was a limited area for us to be in. The tour only took us to various parts of the park where you could sit if you went to a game. We did not see any dugout, press box or get to go on the field. Very disappointing. I've been to several ballpark tours and this was the worst. It was a 2 pm tour on a Saturday and there was a game that night but the players were not even there yet so not sure why we didn't get to see more.</td>\n",

It was like jamming Times Square into a baseball stadium. Fan's packed in on top of each other, small crammed seats, tiny isles, vendors galore because you cannot get out of your seats to get to the insanely crowded food lines in the belly of the stadium. Other fan's are on top of you--- you can hear their conversations in your ear, and if someone farts-- you are going to experience that as well. This placed in certainly grandfathered in for fire and safety codes.

IT IS A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY!! We spent time on the field, were then ushered to sit down, the guide said that there was no time to talk about the history of the park (because the warm-up music started) but if you have questions to ask him. Then up to the Green Monster where we watched batting practice - and the tour was over. Are you kidding me?? The last time we took a group tour which was fun and informative - and you could buy tickets online. For this I had to go the the park earlier in the day to get the tickets? Forget about it!!   \n",

       "28384                          I was so excited to tour Fenway but was disappointed. Our tour guide originally said they were going to split is into two groups because our group was so large but that didn't happen. So that means if you are stuck in the back of the group it is hard to hear and also was a problem when we went to sit up on the green monster and there was a limited area for us to be in. The tour only took us to various parts of the park where you could sit if you went to a game. We did not see any dugout, press box or get to go on the field. Very disappointing. I've been to several ballpark tours and this was the worst. It was a 2 pm tour on a Saturday and there was a game that night but the players were not even there yet so not sure why we didn't get to see more.   \n",

       "34388  I've been to many ballparks--- Fenway provided a sensory overload. The field is iconic, great seats on top of the feel, the crowd was loud an boisterous--- but I will never go back. It was like jamming Times Square into a baseball stadium. Fan's packed in on top of each other, small crammed seats, tiny isles, vendors galore because you cannot get out of your seats to get to the insanely crowded food lines in the belly of the stadium. Other fan's are on top of you--- you can hear their conversations in your ear, and if someone farts-- you are going to experience that as well. This placed in certainly grandfathered in for fire and safety codes. I cannot believe after all these years pining to attend a game at Fenway that I all I can say about the stadium is--- What a dump!   \n",

The lower level of the ship smelled weird, but that can be understood as it was a rainy day.

My two sisters and I were in town for Marathon weekend and (even without children) thoroughly enjoyed the presentation - A mix of play along actors, multimedia and some museum pieces. I think kids under 6 would not really understand. Although it was an enjoyable hour I think it is probably $6 - $9 overpriced. Coming from Canada and adding the exchange rate made it not really worth the $30.US price   \n",

It's not a museum. There are a town hall re-enactment by the staff followed, a pretend tea tossing exercise, a quick walk around the boat, then a couple videos. The tea box handed down through generations is plausible, the tea recovered from the boot not so much. The digital picture technology was cool. Not a 'museum' experience.   \n",

       "23980  The admission fee is about $30/person, and the whole experience does not worth it. You would have a chance to dump the \"tea\" from the ship. Before coming, I expected I would see the \"real tea\" or something similar. The real experience was just dumping some regular boxes, which look like a pillow at my house. The lower level of the ship smelled weird, but that can be understood as it was a rainy day. However, the museum does have some interesting items from the Boston Tea Party, such as a tea container from the event. One short movie about the battle of Lexington and the midnight ride of Paul Revere is also included in the experience. Keep in mind that photos are prohibited for most of the parts.   \n",

It's part of the story. It's why Yawkey Way was renamed. You can't talk about #42 being retired by all of MLB any why (and shame on anyone who doesn't know), but stay mum about that part of your history. Talk about it. Acknowledge it.\n",

      "After attending ball games at several new ballparks constructed throughout the Northeast the last 10-15 years, it's always good to visit an old-time ballpark like Fenway. And it always feels good to watch a game from this ballpark. Just a different feel and look. The Red Sox have done a nice job over the years adding to the experience in and around the ballpark.. Good options for food/drink throughout the ballpark and vendors come very frequently with a variety of food/drink options. The bad... hope you dont get stuck behind a column if sitting in a Grandstand. And they should provide a voucher for a chiropractor or physical therapy after sitting in the horribly ergonomic wooden chairs. The last few times I've gone, my back has felt it pretty badly.\n",

      "Iâ€™m combining two trips in one review. This was our second visit to Fenway so besides seeing a game we decided to take the Fenway tour. Iâ€™ll start with the tour. Nick, our tour-guide was quite knowledgeable and likable. Our problems with the tour was that it was too rushed and too crowded. My wife and I are in our seventies and not as nimble as we once were. Nick, as good as he was, often times left, not only ourselves, but many people far behind. There was one point where our entire tour group was wandering around looking for him. He eventually, noticing that he was alone, came back for us. Also, a bit disappointed that the Pesky Pole was not a part of the tour. Now game time. We purchased tickets online weeks ahead. Grandstand 15, row 1 seats 1 & 2. No mention that seat one has a pillar in front of it, blocking out half the field. NOT HAPPY! Not to worry though, as a diehard Sox fan who seldom gets to Fenway, we will return again but, order tickets from an actual person.\n",

Fenway is what it isâ€” shabby not chic and the crowd makes no apologies for that. After a game at Fenway, you will definitely need a shower and the vibe leans heavily toward beer guzzling, the lines at concession stands are extremely long, food is only average. Good news: even bleacher seats are quite comfy, and an after game stroll down Commonwealth will remind you of the beauty the city offers.\n",

Fenway was 10 on Ballpark dreams, but getting an accessible taxi is a farce. I waited for an hour and the had to roll 2.5 mile and 1 hour to get to my hotel.

So don't discard your Red Sox ticket or you'll pay $42.00 to park. The Seats in the State Street Pavilion are the best I've ever had. I've been going to Fenway for nearly 50 years. My wife and I were very excited to have seats in the State Street Pavilion. We made a dinner reservation in the restaurant. When we arrived we waited around thirty minutes for water. Our waitress apologized profusely and was very pleasent. We elected to eat from the buffet becuase of the selection and fear we would wait another long spell for dinner. The buffet was $43.00. The buffet had a number of interesting choices, but only a couple really hit it out of the park. The onion rings were over cooked, the carving station beef was flavorless and the hush puppies were more like marbles. The buffet also closed early so we weren't able to enjoy the meal and sample the items that looked appetizing. Our bill was $118.00 plus the tip. On the upside, the octopus salad, tandori chicken and pork sliders were very good. Next time we'll order of the menu. We could have saved money and enjoyed dinner more.\n",

      "Fenway Park in Bean Town is to Bostonians as the Pyramids are to the Egyptians, and in some ways, the park feels as old as the pyramids. The 1st thing you are bound to noticer are the little red folding chairs that make up the seating capacity of Fenway. They are prehistoric and uncomfortable. There are blindspots all over the stadium compliments of the vision hiding pillars that are numerous and scattered throughout the seating area, for structural purposes , no doubt. The food vendor facilities are archaic, stairs are dangerous to scale and micro water ponds, to slip and slide, are prevalent after rains. It doesn't matter, games are always sold out. Bostonians love their Soxes and Fenway regardless of what shape it's in. Sooner or later, though, Fenway will have to replaced with a new Fenway. Of particular interest on the field, aside from the players and the game, are the lawn care people. At every chance, these folks appear from nowhere with their 3' grooming brooms to keep the turf in perfectly manicured state. I am told that if there is a dandelion on the field, one of the groomers gets down on their knees and pulls out a pair of giant facial tweezers and plucks the weed out of the ground, root and all. It should be noted that Fenway is recognized for the best grass in the league. Outside the park on game night is a zoo. Cars stay away from any street in close proximity to Fenway because the crowds of people just take over the streets. A significant mobile mall is built up from food trucks and vendor trucks which surrounds Fenway, like a wagon train. Bostonians love their Soxes and are extremely ardent fans. They come with signature hats, hoodies, big fingers, plastic bats secured to their belts like guns in a holster and pillows to soften the blow of the seats on their derriere. I'm not a big baseball fan....baseball to me is basketball in slow motion. There is; however, something iconic and nostalgic about Fenway and the amazing amount of enthusiasm Bostonians general for the Soxes. When in Bean Town you have to take in a game at Fenway Park........Take Me Out To The Ball Game.\n",

There were approximately 70 to 100 people in a herd with a tour guide and microphone. Although Fenway is on the National Register of Historic Places the guide only made mention of this. I would have liked to learn about Fenway's construction....Who were the workers who built it? What did it cost to construct? What VIPS attended games? How about a tour of the Dug Out and Locker Room when the team is on the Road. There was a fund raiser on the field the day I went. Better to close the tour and let us tourists walk the warming track, See the Bull Pen, Hear from the score keepers who post the runs, strikes and outs from inside the Score Board. Although elevators exist which I needed to get around the stadium I was ushered around the building separately from the tour guide and group as a whole. I appreciated the consideration however a knowledgeable alternate tour guide would have been desirable, Overall, my experience was a 6.5 on scale of 10 for want of some the missing elements I mention above and the possibility of missing more of what the tour guide had to say after being ushered away from the group.

We could have been shown the old ticket booths with memorabilia, or inside the scoreboard, or dugout (like most stadiums doo). Didnâ€™t get that.

Quite frankly, it's only that high because of the historical \"cool factor\". It is clearly better than Wrigley and much better than Dodger stadium, two other older parks. The only way to get there really is the T, because parking is insane, as we saw two signs, one was %45, the other $50. The concourse is like a bomb shelter and should have been updated years ago. Do not sit in the grandstand seats. While you are undercover (we had row 1), they didn't change the seats and they are pathetic for the cost. They claim they kept those like they were originally, but they didn't keep the prices the same. If you want to charge 40-75 for a seat, make it comfortable.

The stadium has retained it old world charm with narrow seats, CONSTANT pedestrian movement and the ability to distract you from the game with the business of the stadium. The seating is literally shoulder to shoulder and uncomfortable if sitting for nine innings. The â€œFenway Frankâ€ is very good and the peanuts and cracker jack are standard.

The seats had to have been installed in 1916 and were very uncomfortable and cramped. I had to literally take turns with the fan beside me putting my arms down at my side. The way the park is set up with the support beams and angles of the seats there are many obstructed views of the field. We could see nothing from left center field to the foul pole due to the angle of our seating and the construction of the left field seating wall. The constant flow of vendors carrying wares in front of us obstructed our view as well due the slight slope of the seating to the field level. I Love Boston and The Sox but will probably not go back to Fenway again and will definitely not sit anywhere on 3rd Base side. The Fans were Awesome! We had a great time before the game walking the park and visiting with people in and around the Park. If you want a Beer or Drink bring your ID. We are in our 60â€™s and could not buy a cold one having no idea of this restriction.

      "I was in Boston for work and as a baseball fan, I know that Fenway is considered a must see ball park. There is history at this park, but in my opinion not much else. As another reviewer mentioned, the staff at the park is not friendly, esp the security at entrance. I have been to other parks and esp PNC park and everyone is super friendly from entry to exit. My seat was in the bleacher section and center field. Interesting seat if you donâ€™t care about seeing what is going on in the infield. These seats must be great for catching home run balls. My biggest complaint is about the other fans in attendance. I spent more time getting up and down to let folks pass than I have done in attending several seasons of games. I began to question whether folks attended the game to watch or to go for food and bathroom breaks. It was horrible. If they wanted to see their beloved Socks, then they need to stay seated for more than one inning. Guess it was good for Boston cause the team won the game after a period of rough losses.\n",

Tour guide was very good, she knew her history and facts well, and could relate to some of the great and not so great times at Fenway, we were led through various grandstands and through the press box. I was tad disappointed we never went near players changing rooms, but overall good hours tour and worth it. I was back later on that day to see Red Sox v LA Dodgers. Well worth trip from Englad to see a famous stadium and the Dodgers,\n",

      "I'm not really a huge baseball fan, but I am a sports history fan and the chance to see the Yankees play the Red Sox in a park that has so much history was one that I couldn't pass up. The park itself was really cool. I spent half the time just taking it in and imagining people coming to the games back in the early 1900s. The game was alright (the Red Sox didn't bring their A game that day and lost the game more than the Yankees won it). The gameday experience was only okay. The seats in the grandstand were super uncomfortable. (I just chalked that up to part of the history. They too were probably built in 1911---it certainly felt that way). The hotdog wasn't great. The fries were cold. The tickets were expensive (in my opinion)---$100---but I overall don't regret going. I was there for the history, and seeing two historic teams in a historic park was worth the meh game experience.\n",

There were no ushers stationed around to guide you to your seat, the seats were uncomfortable, the sound system announcing the players was terrible. They certainly can update the stadium without compromising history. Better, larger screens to view the game and other activities would be helpful. We spent most of our time on the MLB app trying to keep track of pitches, outs and the score. The regular attendees were more than helpful if we asked them a question, or we may not have found our seats. I can say \"Been there, done that\" but it was not the most enjoyable baseball game I have been to. My review is not based on sour grapes - our team won both games.\n",

The tour isn't bad but as someone with little knowledge of baseball and a tourist I'd have loved it if the guide had told more of the stories over the years and interesting facts about the Sox. The guide we have had obviously done the tour so often that when speaking his words were merging and we struggled to hear what he was saying. It also wasn't good to see a women struggling up the stand with a baby buggy with the stewards at the rear of the tour just watching her and not offering help. Also, despite the tour ending in a food/drink area it was closed and we couldn't get a drink. Interesting tour but could be alot better.\n",

      "I like old-time baseball stadiums and Fenway Park definitely qualifies as that. They consistently present an entertaining team in a classic setting. That's great. But... Fenway could really use some help. Ticket entry was slow and crowded-- worse than any ballpark I've seen. Lines were all clogged up and hardly moved. Ushers didn't seem real interested in helping us find our seats. Sightlines at Fenway are often lousy-- a lot of lost time due to having to stretch your neck to see around support posts, of which there are many. How many obstructed view seats are there in Fenway, anyhow? Prices were, of course, exorbitant for food; hamburger was lousy, beer was watery. Fans were into the game, for the most part, although many seemed to think they were more knowledgeable than the Red Sox manager. (I'm not a Red Sox fan, but I don't think those fans are right!) Then again, with such high ticket prices, the fans definitely have a right to express their thoughts on pretty much anything the want! Yes, I'll probably return to this ballpark-- a young grandson is a pretty good reason for doing all sorts of things!-- but I'll look at other alternatives too. Boston is a great city, and it deserves better than this.\n",

So that means if you are stuck in the back of the group it is hard to hear and also was a problem when we went to sit up on the green monster and there was a limited area for us to be in. The tour only took us to various parts of the park where you could sit if you went to a game. We did not see any dugout, press box or get to go on the field. Very disappointing.

Fan's packed in on top of each other, small crammed seats, tiny isles, vendors galore because you cannot get out of your seats to get to the insanely crowded food lines in the belly of the stadium. Other fan's are on top of you--- you can hear their conversations in your ear, and if someone farts-- you are going to experience that as well.

The tea room at the end was lovely too. I enjoyed the idea of actually tasting all the teas which were originally aboard the ship, even if I didn't actually enjoy drinking all of them!!

It's great fun and there are some nice surprises which make it great. You learn lots and the actors really involve you (and I'm not someone who likes organised fun). If you buy the old town trolley tours you get this for free which saves you quite a bit of money. Recommended.   \n",

       "34849  What a well planned tourist attraction this is. Loved the introduction where we were all transported back in time to a meeting. My husband had a little speaking part to play which immersed us even more. We learned so much about the night of the 'Tea Party', and very well acted out by all the staff. The tea room at the end was lovely too. I enjoyed the idea of actually tasting all the teas which were originally aboard the ship, even if I didn't actually enjoy drinking all of them!! A little on the pricey side but well worth the visit.   \n",

The cast assigns a character from the era to each guest. I highly recommend it for all ages!   \n",

       "      <td>I hadnâ€™t been back to Fenway Park since I moved away from New England in 1959, but the place still has unsurpassed charm. We went to a get-away game on a Thursday afternoon and the place was still sold out and 90% full. It helped, of course, that the Red Sox are 50 games over .500 and they were playing a good team, the Indians. We had 8 tickets, gotten through the MLB web site, in the grandstand on the first-base side. They were reasonably priced, at $61 a pop. But, yes, you can be behind a post on those lower deck grandstand seats. Still, youâ€™re a lot closer to the field than you would be in similar seats at Dodger Stadium. The amenities are good for a park built in 1912 and the choices are superb. Food and the like are no more expensive than they are at Pac Bell or Chase Field. Just donâ€™t drive and park if you can avoid it. $60 for parking close by is above my pay grade. We had to walk half a mile to save forty bucks. Get there early if possibleâ€”gates open 90 minutes before game timeâ€”and avoid the crush of the sold-out crowds. Boston fans are friendly and affable, even if youâ€™re sporting visiting-team gear (not that we were, but there were some Cleveland fans there). Bring a seat cushion if you sitting in the cheap seats as they are hard and narrow. All in all, if youâ€™re a baseball fan by all means visit Fenway Park when the Red Sox are in town. You donâ€™t need to spend the rent money on tickets, because you are close to the field from anywhere. I do suggest avoiding the lower grandstand because of the possibility of getting stuck behind a post, however. And, oh yeah, the Sox won 7-0. Plus, we found the brick we were looking for. My dad loved his Red Sox. And he loved long enough to see them win the WS in 2004.</td>\n",

       "12     I hadnâ€™t been back to Fenway Park since I moved away from New England in 1959, but the place still has unsurpassed charm. We went to a get-away game on a Thursday afternoon and the place was still sold out and 90% full. It helped, of course, that the Red Sox are 50 games over .500 and they were playing a good team, the Indians. We had 8 tickets, gotten through the MLB web site, in the grandstand on the first-base side. They were reasonably priced, at $61 a pop. But, yes, you can be behind a post on those lower deck grandstand seats. Still, youâ€™re a lot closer to the field than you would be in similar seats at Dodger Stadium. The amenities are good for a park built in 1912 and the choices are superb. Food and the like are no more expensive than they are at Pac Bell or Chase Field. Just donâ€™t drive and park if you can avoid it. $60 for parking close by is above my pay grade. We had to walk half a mile to save forty bucks. Get there early if possibleâ€”gates open 90 minutes before game timeâ€”and avoid the crush of the sold-out crowds. Boston fans are friendly and affable, even if youâ€™re sporting visiting-team gear (not that we were, but there were some Cleveland fans there). Bring a seat cushion if you sitting in the cheap seats as they are hard and narrow. All in all, if youâ€™re a baseball fan by all means visit Fenway Park when the Red Sox are in town. You donâ€™t need to spend the rent money on tickets, because you are close to the field from anywhere. I do suggest avoiding the lower grandstand because of the possibility of getting stuck behind a post, however. And, oh yeah, the Sox won 7-0. Plus, we found the brick we were looking for. My dad loved his Red Sox. And he loved long enough to see them win the WS in 2004.   \n",

We learned so many things about our history and were able to see a lot of historical sites. The only places to get the Jr Ranger program books are Faneuil Hall and Bunker Hill so grab them first or start on that end maybe. We were fine getting ours at Faneuil Hall though and finished them.

Not to mention, itâ€™s worth being a trip to Boston all on its own. Tour for folks of all ages, mostly handicap accessible (due to the age of this period of history). You can do the walk for free, but I honestly recommend that you take advantage of the museums, churches, and other places of interest. If you have little time or ability to walk this trail, please take a Duck or Old Trolley tour!! Truly a MUST-SEE for American or visiting America.</td>\n",

The cemeteries were one if my favorite spots and sitting In the parks were very relaxing. Highly recommend.   \n",
       "16     I've wanted to do this for a long time and finally got to with my own family. The kids were great during the whole walk along the trail and the walk back to the car. If you have kids you might want to prepare them for the long walk or invest in public transport on the way back. We learned so many things about our history and were able to see a lot of historical sites. The only places to get the Jr Ranger program books are Faneuil Hall and Bunker Hill so grab them first or start on that end maybe. We were fine getting ours at Faneuil Hall though and finished them. Walking it does take pretty much all day and some of the places along the trail cost money and some are cash only.   \n",

This is a MUST if you are in the are, or close enough to get there. Not to mention, itâ€™s worth being a trip to Boston all on its own. Tour for folks of all ages, mostly handicap accessible (due to the age of this period of history). You can do the walk for free, but I honestly recommend that you take advantage of the museums, churches, and other places of interest. If you have little time or ability to walk this trail, please take a Duck or Old Trolley tour!! Truly a MUST-SEE for American or visiting America.   \n",

I suggest having a friend who knows the area take you around like I did. If not, there are apps with walking audio tours for the trail. The trail will pretty much take you to all the historical places you'd want to see. It will easily fill up a day if you take your time and stop at all the museums.   \n",

       "      <td>I like the new member plans; however, I wish the instructors who bring students to the museum were more respectful. They are loud and extremely disruptive to a quiet, reflective, appreciating, enjoyable experience. It's honestly like the instructors who teach IN the museum think if they speak louder that their points will become more valid - LOL! Then the students start talking out loud after the instructors set these disrespectful tones and it becomes a big racket - not the best experience on my last visit out of my 100+ visits to this MFA over the years. The museum itself is always changing (for the better). Love the new Monet room and the procurement plaques/\"Art with a History\". Also, the large Renoir of the dancing couple in the market place is back (I think for a while now but it seemed to be on-loan or getting cleaned or just absent for too long), and they've changed up the European room quite a bit, bringing the Gaugan's upstairs, etc. I don't personally care for Gaugan but I think the changes are important because it makes you look at the same pieces, differently, with the different arrangements and comparisons. Overall, the representation of MFA's display of art is superior. Lunch at the main dining cafe with the green chihuly is regularly disappointing. I have to eat here with every visit because it's \"tradition\", but I don't eat/like brussel sprouts or sweet potatoes (regularly their only vegetable sides), and much of their food has onions, scallions or chives which is terrible for someone with an allicin allergy. They've also done away with their delish grain rolls, but the sweet rolls are still there and fantastic. Also - if you eat late around closing, your likely to experience a rack of dishes placed in front of your face. Overall a lousy experience for what should be a superior one. To the contrary, it does seem like the MFA is trying to be more \"user-friendly\" because they have a new lunch special downstairs in the cafeteria that's $8 for a bowl of soup, mini-sandwich and drink which is a stellar price for food at this museum. They also have more friendly priced new $1 dessert bars too. And taste cafe has new mini $5 sandwiches so it seems like they might have heard that eating at the museum was too expensive and addressed this with adding more friendly valued items. It's noticeable and appreciated. The museum overall however is fantastic. I live in Miami now and we have nothing like this on the southeastern side of the U.S. I either have to travel to Boston or Paris to get my \"art fix\", and while I usually choose Paris, and in-spite of all the bad experiences I just had on this visit to the MFA, I have to say the collection is fresh and excellent. I think their audio guide constantly telling us that they have the best of this or that (someone's constant personal opinion that mfa pieces are best) is a bit much - but I always get the audio guide and find it is well worth it with every visit too. There's some really great information on the audio-guide to help you learn more about and appreciate art - and I have to say that I am so incredibly impressed that this MFA is in such a small city as Boston. I wish every city could have such a collection where we could go, enjoy, reflect and appreciate history, creativity and time.</td>\n",

Shows are always well done and provide great information on the artist and the way the work is constructed. We consider ourselves lucky to live so close that we can visit often. There is also a great restaurant at the muceum.   \n",

Well known for its impressionist collection, Sargent murals, Early American silver sculpture and regular exhibits. You can't do it all in one day. So take a tour, eat at the Atrium, and admire the architecture. If you can fit it in the special exhibit, More than that you will get museum freeze. Plan to come back soon!! Think about a membership and save on lunch, parking and admission, It is worth it.   \n",

We spent a half day but could have spent a full day. Really enjoyed the cafÃ©.   \n",

       "34589  I like the new member plans; however, I wish the instructors who bring students to the museum were more respectful. They are loud and extremely disruptive to a quiet, reflective, appreciating, enjoyable experience. It's honestly like the instructors who teach IN the museum think if they speak louder that their points will become more valid - LOL! Then the students start talking out loud after the instructors set these disrespectful tones and it becomes a big racket - not the best experience on my last visit out of my 100+ visits to this MFA over the years. The museum itself is always changing (for the better). Love the new Monet room and the procurement plaques/\"Art with a History\". Also, the large Renoir of the dancing couple in the market place is back (I think for a while now but it seemed to be on-loan or getting cleaned or just absent for too long), and they've changed up the European room quite a bit, bringing the Gaugan's upstairs, etc. I don't personally care for Gaugan but I think the changes are important because it makes you look at the same pieces, differently, with the different arrangements and comparisons. Overall, the representation of MFA's display of art is superior. Lunch at the main dining cafe with the green chihuly is regularly disappointing. I have to eat here with every visit because it's \"tradition\", but I don't eat/like brussel sprouts or sweet potatoes (regularly their only vegetable sides), and much of their food has onions, scallions or chives which is terrible for someone with an allicin allergy. They've also done away with their delish grain rolls, but the sweet rolls are still there and fantastic. Also - if you eat late around closing, your likely to experience a rack of dishes placed in front of your face. Overall a lousy experience for what should be a superior one. To the contrary, it does seem like the MFA is trying to be more \"user-friendly\" because they have a new lunch special downstairs in the cafeteria that's $8 for a bowl of soup, mini-sandwich and drink which is a stellar price for food at this museum. They also have more friendly priced new $1 dessert bars too. And taste cafe has new mini $5 sandwiches so it seems like they might have heard that eating at the museum was too expensive and addressed this with adding more friendly valued items. It's noticeable and appreciated. The museum overall however is fantastic. I live in Miami now and we have nothing like this on the southeastern side of the U.S. I either have to travel to Boston or Paris to get my \"art fix\", and while I usually choose Paris, and in-spite of all the bad experiences I just had on this visit to the MFA, I have to say the collection is fresh and excellent. I think their audio guide constantly telling us that they have the best of this or that (someone's constant personal opinion that mfa pieces are best) is a bit much - but I always get the audio guide and find it is well worth it with every visit too. There's some really great information on the audio-guide to help you learn more about and appreciate art - and I have to say that I am so incredibly impressed that this MFA is in such a small city as Boston. I wish every city could have such a collection where we could go, enjoy, reflect and appreciate history, creativity and time.   \n",

Inside we started in the European section which is on three floors. There was a great deal to enjoy but especially the Impressionists section and most especially Signac Port of Sant-Cast, Monet Haystack in the snow and a stunning painting by Theodore van Rysselberghe Belgian The Regatta 1892. The American section was also interesting and I enjoyed the Wilmslow Homer and John Singer Sergeant and Whistler paintings. The main atrium is very impressive with a superb giant Green Thistle superb. We took a break at Taste CafÃ© and went on to the special exhibitions. If I lived in Boston I would definitely become a member so as to visit here often. There is so much to see and enjoy.   \n",

It is good and I love that with the standard admission, you get to come back one more time for free.   \n",

Some amazing American history. It also happening to be lunar New year and they had some wonderful performances going on, though we only caught glances. Definitely worth a trip to the MFA.   \n",

The rooms are comfortable (not huge or cramped) and for us, the number of pieces in each section was perfect. The ancient stone exhibits as well as modern jewelry exhibits had thoughtful descriptions in a style that was somewhat conversational. The pieces on display were diverse and thought provoking. Find the enormous foam cup light display on the ceiling near the children 'flying' in a dream. My daughter will be reading the Odyssey this year and wanted to check out Ancient Greece but it was not open.

The hostess to this event was also in colonial dress. Both individuals were well versed and friendly with the attendees. Each person is given a card representing a real resident at the time of the tea party. If you wish to participate in the discussion request such a person. After you go on the replica ship and speak with a mate from the ship. You can tour the ship and go below and observe the cargo. Then you get the opportunity to throw a box of tea into the harbor. Inside there is then a lively discussion between two local women on the implication of the tea party. A movie about the Revolution, as well as an argument between Sam Adams and King George lllis next. A small cafe and gift shop are also on site. The gift shop had a wide variety of items that were reasonably priced. This was one of the best historical attractions I have ever visited. If in the Boston area, don't miss it.</td>\n",

We had to leave knowing we were only 1/2 through; my 14 year old would have stayed until closing. The rooms are comfortable (not huge or cramped) and for us, the number of pieces in each section was perfect. The ancient stone exhibits as well as modern jewelry exhibits had thoughtful descriptions in a style that was somewhat conversational. The pieces on display were diverse and thought provoking. Find the enormous foam cup light display on the ceiling near the children 'flying' in a dream. My daughter will be reading the Odyssey this year and wanted to check out Ancient Greece but it was not open. Brunch at the Bravo restaurant was excellent When we visit again we will try an audio tour.   \n",
       "23270  During our last trip to Boston we visited the Tea Party Museum. First we attended a mock town meeting where the merits of protesting the tax on tea was discussed by Samuel Adams. The hostess to this event was also in colonial dress. Both individuals were well versed and friendly with the attendees. Each person is given a card representing a real resident at the time of the tea party. If you wish to participate in the discussion request such a person. After you go on the replica ship and speak with a mate from the ship. You can tour the ship and go below and observe the cargo. Then you get the opportunity to throw a box of tea into the harbor. Inside there is then a lively discussion between two local women on the implication of the tea party. A movie about the Revolution, as well as an argument between Sam Adams and King George lllis next. A small cafe and gift shop are also on site. The gift shop had a wide variety of items that were reasonably priced. This was one of the best historical attractions I have ever visited. If in the Boston area, don't miss it.   \n",

Every thing is recreated like the 18th century ship, actors taking on roles of the rebel leaders and children among the visitors being asked to throw sample boxes into the sea. But somehow the feeling that it is all a show, lingers. The only thing from the past is an actual tea chest which is exhibited. The actors take too long to enact some of the scenes (for example, the speech to the patriots in the hall). Talking portraits and a short movie included could not take away the feeling that the museum was desperately trying to sell an important piece of American history.

       "23582  The actual place where the Boston tea party rebellion occured is now reclaimed land with high rise buildings. This museum is slightly away from the actual spot. Every thing is recreated like the 18th century ship, actors taking on roles of the rebel leaders and children among the visitors being asked to throw sample boxes into the sea. But somehow the feeling that it is all a show, lingers. The only thing from the past is an actual tea chest which is exhibited. The actors take too long to enact some of the scenes (for example, the speech to the patriots in the hall). Talking portraits and a short movie included could not take away the feeling that the museum was desperately trying to sell an important piece of American history. The visit took one and a half hours; something that should not take more than 30 minutes. The tickets are grossly over priced.   \n",

       "      <td>My spouse and I visited Bostonâ€™s Museum of Fine Arts (MFA) on a Saturday afternoon in late May 2017. The museum is open daily from approximately 10:00 am until 5:00 pm, with extended hours until 10:00 pm on Wednesdays (including â€œWinedaysâ€ social event), Thursdays, and Fridays (including the monthly reoccurring â€œFirst Fridayâ€ cocktail party). Be sure to check their website for exact details. Admission costs $25 per adult, but you can enjoy a repeat visit within 10 days. If you visit the neighboring Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum (ISGM), you can save $2 on a combined admission. You are requested to check larger bags at the coat check counter. The over 600,000-square foot museum (founded in 1870) opened in its present Fenway-Kenmore neighborhood location in the early 1900s. The museum seems to occupy a series of interconnected buildings and wings (which makes navigating around a bit tricky). The museum collection is displayed in over 30 spacious, high-ceilinged galleries spread over four floors (including the basement). You can use either stairs or elevators to travel between the levels. Several dining options are available, including Bravo, American CafÃ©, Taste, and the Garden Cafeteria (listed in descending order from most formal/expensive to least). The expansive glass-enclosed courtyard hosts one of my favorite pieces in the museum, Dale Chihulyâ€™s 42-foot-high lime green icicle tower. Another favorite space is the rotunda with colonnades and frescoes painted by John Singer Sargent. (We loved how the museum placed a mirror in the center of the first floor space so that you can view the reflected ceiling paintings without craning your neck - an interesting technique that we had not seen before!) The architecture of the museum itself is almost as interesting as the objects that hang inside it. The MFA's vast and varied collection of approximately 450,000 objects includes works by American painters (Homer, Sargent, Hopper, and Cassatt), Impressionists (Monet, Manet, Renoir, Degas, Van Gogh, Cezanne), sculptures, furniture, Egyptian artifacts, Asian art from Japan and China, African masks, Native American pottery, and contemporary art. At any one time, the museum offers many rotating temporary exhibitions by a variety of artists. When we visited, the current exhibitions featured Botticelli, Matisse, Robert McCloskey (of â€œMake Way for Duckingsâ€ fame), Polish ghetto photographs, and jewelry (including pieces by Tiffany, Cartier, and Bulgari). We enjoyed our visit to the Museum of Fine Arts â€“ the building is beautiful, the permanent collection is excellent, and the rotating exhibitions are interesting.</td>\n",

       "      <td>â€¦.I FOUND IT SO INTERESTING, I KNOCKED IT OVER IN ONE GO. Hereâ€™s the thing â€“ you donâ€™t have to do this walk in one hit â€“ it can easily be divided into 3: 1 â€“ the stuff at and close to BOSTON COMMON** out to and including BOSTON PUBLIC MARKET**. 2 â€“ the rest of the south of the CHARLES RIVER attractions 3 â€“ the 2 attractions north of the CHARLES. Or less if you are really time-short. I will leave it to you to check the 3 zones and their attractions on the many online sites and figure out what works for you. I initially decided to split the walk in two â€“ zones 1+ 2 combined and then check out the over-river places sometime later. But as my hero JOHN MEYNARD KEYNES said: â€œwhen the facts change, I change my mindâ€. The facts in my case were I was enjoying the trail much more than initially thought and despite my 74yo arthritic knees crying â€œRESTâ€, I was in reality far from quitting â€“ so I charged (um- actually limped) across the NORTH WASHINGTON ST BRIDGE over the CHARLES and spent the next hour or so checking out the USS CONSTITUTION** area + the BUNKER HILL MONUMENT**. TIPS â€“ spend a bit of time in the VISITORSâ€™ CENTER in BOSTON COMMON** at the start of the trail â€“ lotsa good info here including maps/notes of the trail. - they say you can knock over the trail in 2 hours but time consuming things like BOSTON PUBLIC MARKETS**, USS CONSTITUTION** and BUNKER HILL MONUMENT** could easily add and hour+ EACH. Perhaps more. - be prepared for the USS CONSTITUTION**/USS CASSEIN YOUNG** (Fletcher class destroyer) at the CHARLSTOWN NAVAL SHIPYARD**, This area is under navel jurisdiction and has those airport-type baggage checks at entry (including the museum). Because I had a drink bottle over the mandatory 100ml and because these security checks to me are getting a bit onerous, I gave these areas the big miss. Actually there is plenty to see from the outside. The good news is that the BUNKER HILL MONUMENT (administered by the NATIONAL PARK SERVICE) had no such nonsense. - getting back to the central city seemed an easy, relatively straight shot to me, but I must admit I got a bit lost. Do yer research. SUM UP â€“ online guides say you can knock the full walk over in 2 hours â€“ but spending the time some of the stops justify could see you using much of the day. A good one. ** Tripadvisor has user reviews pages on all.</td>\n",

But, boy, are we glad we went there ! What a great surprise to find such a huge collection of Dutch Golden Age and French impressionists ! Being European tourists, that's where we spent all of our time ; but we learned later that the American Art displays are even more impressive. So much splendid art, so little time . . . next time, for sure.   \n",

The Matisse exhibit was interesting as the you can see the works with the objects of inspiration including a pewter jug, a chocolate maker, an Andalusian vase, textiles, sculptures and masks.   \n",

We walked it several times on our way from Boston Common to a restaurant around Faneuil Hall. Then finally we bought tickets for the guided tour from the kiosk in Boston Common and joined a small group of about 8 people. The tour guide was most informative and entertaining : at $ 12 per person it is a small investment to learn heaps about an important period of Boston's (and America's !) history in a fun way.   \n",

The weather was ok and it wasnâ€™t that crowded. Itâ€™s a great old park that is full of character and they embrace the past. Itâ€™s a great place to go.

       "21284  My spouse and I visited Bostonâ€™s Museum of Fine Arts (MFA) on a Saturday afternoon in late May 2017. The museum is open daily from approximately 10:00 am until 5:00 pm, with extended hours until 10:00 pm on Wednesdays (including â€œWinedaysâ€ social event), Thursdays, and Fridays (including the monthly reoccurring â€œFirst Fridayâ€ cocktail party). Be sure to check their website for exact details. Admission costs $25 per adult, but you can enjoy a repeat visit within 10 days. If you visit the neighboring Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum (ISGM), you can save $2 on a combined admission. You are requested to check larger bags at the coat check counter. The over 600,000-square foot museum (founded in 1870) opened in its present Fenway-Kenmore neighborhood location in the early 1900s. The museum seems to occupy a series of interconnected buildings and wings (which makes navigating around a bit tricky). The museum collection is displayed in over 30 spacious, high-ceilinged galleries spread over four floors (including the basement). You can use either stairs or elevators to travel between the levels. Several dining options are available, including Bravo, American CafÃ©, Taste, and the Garden Cafeteria (listed in descending order from most formal/expensive to least). The expansive glass-enclosed courtyard hosts one of my favorite pieces in the museum, Dale Chihulyâ€™s 42-foot-high lime green icicle tower. Another favorite space is the rotunda with colonnades and frescoes painted by John Singer Sargent. (We loved how the museum placed a mirror in the center of the first floor space so that you can view the reflected ceiling paintings without craning your neck - an interesting technique that we had not seen before!) The architecture of the museum itself is almost as interesting as the objects that hang inside it. The MFA's vast and varied collection of approximately 450,000 objects includes works by American painters (Homer, Sargent, Hopper, and Cassatt), Impressionists (Monet, Manet, Renoir, Degas, Van Gogh, Cezanne), sculptures, furniture, Egyptian artifacts, Asian art from Japan and China, African masks, Native American pottery, and contemporary art. At any one time, the museum offers many rotating temporary exhibitions by a variety of artists. When we visited, the current exhibitions featured Botticelli, Matisse, Robert McCloskey (of â€œMake Way for Duckingsâ€ fame), Polish ghetto photographs, and jewelry (including pieces by Tiffany, Cartier, and Bulgari). We enjoyed our visit to the Museum of Fine Arts â€“ the building is beautiful, the permanent collection is excellent, and the rotating exhibitions are interesting.   \n",

But the permanent collection is very strong, especially in American art and the Impressionists. Lovely place to spend an afternoon -- beautifully curated and nicely separated collections.   \n",

You can walk at your leisure as there is literally a line in the ground to guide you. I'd probably recommend a small group walking tour or a good guide book to learn as much as possible.   \n",

Hereâ€™s the thing â€“ you donâ€™t have to do this walk in one hit â€“ it can easily be divided into 3: 1 â€“ the stuff at and close to BOSTON COMMON** out to and including BOSTON PUBLIC MARKET**. 2 â€“ the rest of the south of the CHARLES RIVER attractions 3 â€“ the 2 attractions north of the CHARLES. Or less if you are really time-short. I will leave it to you to check the 3 zones and their attractions on the many online sites and figure out what works for you. I initially decided to split the walk in two â€“ zones 1+ 2 combined and then check out the over-river places sometime later. But as my hero JOHN MEYNARD KEYNES said: â€œwhen the facts change, I change my mindâ€. The facts in my case were I was enjoying the trail much more than initially thought and despite my 74yo arthritic knees crying â€œRESTâ€, I was in reality far from quitting â€“ so I charged (um- actually limped) across the NORTH WASHINGTON ST BRIDGE over the CHARLES and spent the next hour or so checking out the USS CONSTITUTION** area + the BUNKER HILL MONUMENT**. TIPS â€“ spend a bit of time in the VISITORSâ€™ CENTER in BOSTON COMMON** at the start of the trail â€“ lotsa good info here including maps/notes of the trail. - they say you can knock over the trail in 2 hours but time consuming things like BOSTON PUBLIC MARKETS**, USS CONSTITUTION** and BUNKER HILL MONUMENT** could easily add and hour+ EACH. Perhaps more. - be prepared for the USS CONSTITUTION**/USS CASSEIN YOUNG** (Fletcher class destroyer) at the CHARLSTOWN NAVAL SHIPYARD**, This area is under navel jurisdiction and has those airport-type baggage checks at entry (including the museum). Because I had a drink bottle over the mandatory 100ml and because these security checks to me are getting a bit onerous, I gave these areas the big miss. Actually there is plenty to see from the outside. The good news is that the BUNKER HILL MONUMENT (administered by the NATIONAL PARK SERVICE) had no such nonsense. - getting back to the central city seemed an easy, relatively straight shot to me, but I must admit I got a bit lost. Do yer research. SUM UP â€“ online guides say you can knock the full walk over in 2 hours â€“ but spending the time some of the stops justify could see you using much of the day. A good one. ** Tripadvisor has user reviews pages on all.   \n",

Parking is a bit of a challenge but once that is done (nice lot across from the skating rink) it is fun to just roam around and see where you end up. I always am looking for a good meal and there are dozens of places to choose from. There are also dessert places and places just for a drink. If you are budget minded there a good places for pizza. The Old North Church is in the middle of the North End and a lovely statue of Paul Revere. Spend a couple of hours strolling around here. A must do for visitors of Boston   \n",

You can take this tour and finish with very little idea of what the event was, what led up to it, or why it turned out to be significant. The only thought that seeps through is that if you are angry over an insignificant tax, it is ok to destroy other people's property. An actress of limited ability plays the role of an actual participant, and conducts the tour, which is not really a museum visit but a replica ship and then a series of rooms with videos. At over $25 a head, this is not a good way to spend your tourist dollar.   \n",

But, boy, are we glad we went there ! What a great surprise to find such a huge collection of Dutch Golden Age and French impressionists ! Being European tourists, that's where we spent all of our time ; but we learned later that the American Art displays are even more impressive.

       "      <td>My spouse and I visited Bostonâ€™s Museum of Fine Arts (MFA) on a Saturday afternoon in late May 2017. The museum is open daily from approximately 10:00 am until 5:00 pm, with extended hours until 10:00 pm on Wednesdays (including â€œWinedaysâ€ social event), Thursdays, and Fridays (including the monthly reoccurring â€œFirst Fridayâ€ cocktail party). Be sure to check their website for exact details. Admission costs $25 per adult, but you can enjoy a repeat visit within 10 days. If you visit the neighboring Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum (ISGM), you can save $2 on a combined admission. You are requested to check larger bags at the coat check counter. The over 600,000-square foot museum (founded in 1870) opened in its present Fenway-Kenmore neighborhood location in the early 1900s. The museum seems to occupy a series of interconnected buildings and wings (which makes navigating around a bit tricky). The museum collection is displayed in over 30 spacious, high-ceilinged galleries spread over four floors (including the basement). You can use either stairs or elevators to travel between the levels. Several dining options are available, including Bravo, American CafÃ©, Taste, and the Garden Cafeteria (listed in descending order from most formal/expensive to least). The expansive glass-enclosed courtyard hosts one of my favorite pieces in the museum, Dale Chihulyâ€™s 42-foot-high lime green icicle tower. Another favorite space is the rotunda with colonnades and frescoes painted by John Singer Sargent. (We loved how the museum placed a mirror in the center of the first floor space so that you can view the reflected ceiling paintings without craning your neck - an interesting technique that we had not seen before!) The architecture of the museum itself is almost as interesting as the objects that hang inside it. The MFA's vast and varied collection of approximately 450,000 objects includes works by American painters (Homer, Sargent, Hopper, and Cassatt), Impressionists (Monet, Manet, Renoir, Degas, Van Gogh, Cezanne), sculptures, furniture, Egyptian artifacts, Asian art from Japan and China, African masks, Native American pottery, and contemporary art. At any one time, the museum offers many rotating temporary exhibitions by a variety of artists. When we visited, the current exhibitions featured Botticelli, Matisse, Robert McCloskey (of â€œMake Way for Duckingsâ€ fame), Polish ghetto photographs, and jewelry (including pieces by Tiffany, Cartier, and Bulgari).

       "      <td>â€¦.I FOUND IT SO INTERESTING, I KNOCKED IT OVER IN ONE GO. Hereâ€™s the thing â€“ you donâ€™t have to do this walk in one hit â€“ it can easily be divided into 3: 1 â€“ the stuff at and close to BOSTON COMMON** out to and including BOSTON PUBLIC MARKET**. 2 â€“ the rest of the south of the CHARLES RIVER attractions 3 â€“ the 2 attractions north of the CHARLES. Or less if you are really time-short. I will leave it to you to check the 3 zones and their attractions on the many online sites and figure out what works for you. I initially decided to split the walk in two â€“ zones 1+ 2 combined and then check out the over-river places sometime later. But as my hero JOHN MEYNARD KEYNES said: â€œwhen the facts change, I change my mindâ€. The facts in my case were I was enjoying the trail much more than initially thought and despite my 74yo arthritic knees crying â€œRESTâ€, I was in reality far from quitting â€“ so I charged (um- actually limped) across the NORTH WASHINGTON ST BRIDGE over the CHARLES and spent the next hour or so checking out the USS CONSTITUTION** area + the BUNKER HILL MONUMENT**. TIPS â€“ spend a bit of time in the VISITORSâ€™ CENTER in BOSTON COMMON** at the start of the trail â€“ lotsa good info here including maps/notes of the trail. - they say you can knock over the trail in 2 hours but time consuming things like BOSTON PUBLIC MARKETS**, USS CONSTITUTION** and BUNKER HILL MONUMENT** could easily add and hour+ EACH. Perhaps more. - be prepared for the USS CONSTITUTION**/USS CASSEIN YOUNG** (Fletcher class destroyer) at the CHARLSTOWN NAVAL SHIPYARD**, This area is under navel jurisdiction and has those airport-type baggage checks at entry (including the museum). Because I had a drink bottle over the mandatory 100ml and because these security checks to me are getting a bit onerous, I gave these areas the big miss. Actually there is plenty to see from the outside. The good news is that the BUNKER HILL MONUMENT (administered by the NATIONAL PARK SERVICE) had no such nonsense. - getting back to the central city seemed an easy, relatively straight shot to me, but I must admit I got a bit lost. Do yer research. SUM UP â€“ online guides say you can knock the full walk over in 2 hours â€“ but spending the time some of the stops justify could see you using much of the day. A good one. ** Tripadvisor has user reviews pages on all.</td>\n",

But, boy, are we glad we went there ! What a great surprise to find such a huge collection of Dutch Golden Age and French impressionists ! Being European tourists, that's where we spent all of our time ; but we learned later that the American Art displays are even more impressive. So much splendid art, so little time . . . next time, for sure.  \n",

The Matisse exhibit was interesting as the you can see the works with the objects of inspiration including a pewter jug, a chocolate maker, an Andalusian vase, textiles, sculptures and masks.  \n",

We walked it several times on our way from Boston Common to a restaurant around Faneuil Hall. Then finally we bought tickets for the guided tour from the kiosk in Boston Common and joined a small group of about 8 people. The tour guide was most informative and entertaining : at $ 12 per person it is a small investment to learn heaps about an important period of Boston's (and America's !) history in a fun way.  \n",

The weather was ok and it wasnâ€™t that crowded. Itâ€™s a great old park that is full of character and they embrace the past. Itâ€™s a great place to go.

       "21284  My spouse and I visited Bostonâ€™s Museum of Fine Arts (MFA) on a Saturday afternoon in late May 2017. The museum is open daily from approximately 10:00 am until 5:00 pm, with extended hours until 10:00 pm on Wednesdays (including â€œWinedaysâ€ social event), Thursdays, and Fridays (including the monthly reoccurring â€œFirst Fridayâ€ cocktail party). Be sure to check their website for exact details. Admission costs $25 per adult, but you can enjoy a repeat visit within 10 days. If you visit the neighboring Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum (ISGM), you can save $2 on a combined admission. You are requested to check larger bags at the coat check counter. The over 600,000-square foot museum (founded in 1870) opened in its present Fenway-Kenmore neighborhood location in the early 1900s. The museum seems to occupy a series of interconnected buildings and wings (which makes navigating around a bit tricky). The museum collection is displayed in over 30 spacious, high-ceilinged galleries spread over four floors (including the basement). You can use either stairs or elevators to travel between the levels. Several dining options are available, including Bravo, American CafÃ©, Taste, and the Garden Cafeteria (listed in descending order from most formal/expensive to least). The expansive glass-enclosed courtyard hosts one of my favorite pieces in the museum, Dale Chihulyâ€™s 42-foot-high lime green icicle tower. Another favorite space is the rotunda with colonnades and frescoes painted by John Singer Sargent. (We loved how the museum placed a mirror in the center of the first floor space so that you can view the reflected ceiling paintings without craning your neck - an interesting technique that we had not seen before!) The architecture of the museum itself is almost as interesting as the objects that hang inside it. The MFA's vast and varied collection of approximately 450,000 objects includes works by American painters (Homer, Sargent, Hopper, and Cassatt), Impressionists (Monet, Manet, Renoir, Degas, Van Gogh, Cezanne), sculptures, furniture, Egyptian artifacts, Asian art from Japan and China, African masks, Native American pottery, and contemporary art. At any one time, the museum offers many rotating temporary exhibitions by a variety of artists. When we visited, the current exhibitions featured Botticelli, Matisse, Robert McCloskey (of â€œMake Way for Duckingsâ€ fame), Polish ghetto photographs, and jewelry (including pieces by Tiffany, Cartier, and Bulgari). We enjoyed our visit to the Museum of Fine Arts â€“ the building is beautiful, the permanent collection is excellent, and the rotating exhibitions are interesting.  \n",

But the permanent collection is very strong, especially in American art and the Impressionists. Lovely place to spend an afternoon -- beautifully curated and nicely separated collections.  \n",

You can walk at your leisure as there is literally a line in the ground to guide you. I'd probably recommend a small group walking tour or a good guide book to learn as much as possible.  \n",

Hereâ€™s the thing â€“ you donâ€™t have to do this walk in one hit â€“ it can easily be divided into 3: 1 â€“ the stuff at and close to BOSTON COMMON** out to and including BOSTON PUBLIC MARKET**. 2 â€“ the rest of the south of the CHARLES RIVER attractions 3 â€“ the 2 attractions north of the CHARLES. Or less if you are really time-short. I will leave it to you to check the 3 zones and their attractions on the many online sites and figure out what works for you. I initially decided to split the walk in two â€“ zones 1+ 2 combined and then check out the over-river places sometime later. But as my hero JOHN MEYNARD KEYNES said: â€œwhen the facts change, I change my mindâ€. The facts in my case were I was enjoying the trail much more than initially thought and despite my 74yo arthritic knees crying â€œRESTâ€, I was in reality far from quitting â€“ so I charged (um- actually limped) across the NORTH WASHINGTON ST BRIDGE over the CHARLES and spent the next hour or so checking out the USS CONSTITUTION** area + the BUNKER HILL MONUMENT**. TIPS â€“ spend a bit of time in the VISITORSâ€™ CENTER in BOSTON COMMON** at the start of the trail â€“ lotsa good info here including maps/notes of the trail. - they say you can knock over the trail in 2 hours but time consuming things like BOSTON PUBLIC MARKETS**, USS CONSTITUTION** and BUNKER HILL MONUMENT** could easily add and hour+ EACH. Perhaps more. - be prepared for the USS CONSTITUTION**/USS CASSEIN YOUNG** (Fletcher class destroyer) at the CHARLSTOWN NAVAL SHIPYARD**, This area is under navel jurisdiction and has those airport-type baggage checks at entry (including the museum). Because I had a drink bottle over the mandatory 100ml and because these security checks to me are getting a bit onerous, I gave these areas the big miss. Actually there is plenty to see from the outside. The good news is that the BUNKER HILL MONUMENT (administered by the NATIONAL PARK SERVICE) had no such nonsense. - getting back to the central city seemed an easy, relatively straight shot to me, but I must admit I got a bit lost. Do yer research. SUM UP â€“ online guides say you can knock the full walk over in 2 hours â€“ but spending the time some of the stops justify could see you using much of the day. A good one. ** Tripadvisor has user reviews pages on all.  \n",

Parking is a bit of a challenge but once that is done (nice lot across from the skating rink) it is fun to just roam around and see where you end up. I always am looking for a good meal and there are dozens of places to choose from. There are also dessert places and places just for a drink. If you are budget minded there a good places for pizza. The Old North Church is in the middle of the North End and a lovely statue of Paul Revere. Spend a couple of hours strolling around here. A must do for visitors of Boston  \n",

You can take this tour and finish with very little idea of what the event was, what led up to it, or why it turned out to be significant. The only thought that seeps through is that if you are angry over an insignificant tax, it is ok to destroy other people's property. An actress of limited ability plays the role of an actual participant, and conducts the tour, which is not really a museum visit but a replica ship and then a series of rooms with videos. At over $25 a head, this is not a good way to spend your tourist dollar.  \n",

There is a bit of everything here, much like New York's Met but more manageable in size. We especially liked the American Revolutionary era paintings and American Impressionists. The central atrium houses an upscale cafe.  \n",
