This trip we went down to the lake, the boat house, Strawberry Fields and the Bethesda commonly known as being featured in Friends. We enjoyed seeing the park on a crisp winter's day. Such a contrast from the height of summer but beautiful nonetheless. Seeing so many people congregated at Strawberry Fields' Imagine mosaic really brought home how much John Lennon meant to the people and how much the Park meant to John Lennon. The mall is a good walk through to the lake from the park entrance at 59th street. Street artists and vendors add a bit of vibe. If in NYC this is a must see.",WOW!

Central Park,New York City,Feb 2020,February 2020,753,137,0,5,"There are a couple of places you can read reviews for Central Park on TripAdvisor, so I wasn't sure where best to leave a post. Like so many people, I grew up in NYC, even saw concerts there during the summer, yet I don't know the park at all. Frederick Olmsted designed the park to be welcoming and inclusive to all regardless of class and most importantly he wanted the park to be and seem natural. Of course you can enter the park and wander, but way more interesting is to book a walking tour through the Central Park site. The fees are reasonable, you learn a lot and part of the fee goes right back into the park. In Central Park there's a Carousel, an Ice Rick, a Boat Basin, a Childrens Zoo, Playground, playing fields, rocks so smooth you can slide down them, promenades, quiet pathways. So much. The tours will really enhance your visit.",To truly appreciate the park take one of the  Central Park  Walking Tours,cjyap,"Griswold, Connecticut"

The horse drawn carriages are licensed and the bicycle ones are not. The drivers are super nice. Our driver gave us a carrot to feed our horse, Roger.

Central Park,New York City,Feb 2020,November 2019,385,160,0,5,"Central Park is one of our favourite spaces in New York City and we make an effort to stroll through it every time that we visit NYC. It is simultaneously a beautiful oasis of calm and a centre of activity in the heart of busy Manhattan. While the Park attracts many tourists, particularly near Central Park South, it also is a great way to get a glimpse of New Yorkers relaxing - reading, chatting, strolling, jogging, picnicking, rowing, cycling, playing, dog walking and just people watching. Walking across the Park gives you a vivid sense of the noticeable differences between New Yorkers from the more proper East Side (east of Fifth Avenue) and those from the more relaxed West Side. If you have the opportunity, attending an outdoor concert or theatrical performance in the Park is a memorable experience that will last a lifetime. Strolling its paths, over its bridges and around its lakes, fountains and fields always helps us to put our frenzied visits to NYC in perspective. We highly recommend including Central Park in any visit to NYC.",An Oasis in NYC,Canadianstraveling,"Oakville, Canada"

Central Park,New York City,Feb 2020,February 2020,139,32,1,4,"After my first little foray into Central Park in Dec 2018 and the realisation that it is HUGE on this trip we decided to book a Pedi-Cab. We booked using Ivan who owns Central Park Airlines and we are so glad we did! Ivan was super friendly and knowledgeable; flying us all around the park in his Pedi-Cab pointing out lots of interesting buildings with tit-bits of information. We did quite a few stops too for pictures which he did using my phone and his own (he forwarded the pictures he took to my Mum afterwards using Facebook). Ivan took some great pictures! I’d definitely recommend booking a Pedi-Cab with him! Central Park itself was beautiful; so much so that I decided to stay behind and walk around a bit when my Mum, Sister and Cousin left. The weather was glorious and after the tour I felt a bit more confident with my bearings (and also with a little help from google maps!) I came across a group performance of guys doing jumping stunts over people which had drawn a big crowd. That was fun to watch although a bit too drawn out between stunts so I left after a short while.",Great Pedi Cab,KopiteKat,"Cheltenham, United Kingdom"

There are plenty of horse and carriages if you want a leisurely ride around the park, they have prices on the side of the carriages but they are negotiable. Alternatively, there are lots of rickshaws too but they seemed very expensive this time. The carriage and rickshaw drivers all give you information about the park during the trip and they point out celebrity homes too.

Central Park,New York City,Mar 2020,September 2019,15,1,0,5,"Central Park became one of our highlights in New York. It is huge but some London parks are competitive in that sense. However, the atmosphere is livelier and some of the views of the skyscrapers are astounding, although this was undoubtedly aided by the beautiful weather in August. Even the buskers are impressive. I would strongly recommend hiring bikes. You can cycle around in an hour and a lot of it is downhill but you can see a lot more this way. Only a few short parts are uphill but it is suitable for amateur, leisure cyclists. I would avoid the sellers who come offering bikes, go online and look for vouchers or deals; you can find 2 bikes for 5 hours for a total of $25.

The singing birds, the fat squirrels, the elusive turtles, the stone bridges, the ponds, lakes, and waterfalls. It’s all there. And you can explore it without ever putting shoe to dirt. There are cleverly cut paths that run seamlessly with the natural flow of the landscape. Every once in awhile, while meandering through the forest you’ll see a person who appears to be frozen in time. Just one of the many statues placed throughout the park. It would take me all night to tell you everything lovely about Central Park. If it weren’t for the breathtaking city views you catch a glimpse of through a clearing of trees, or from the top of a rock, you would forget that you were in the middle of the most densely populated city in America! Advice: If you rent a bike to ride through the park, be prepared to dismount a lot. You can only ride your bike one way on designated bike lanes around the park’s perimeter, except for an occasional cut-through. There are rules of the road for bikers...you can’t just leisurely ride your bike through the park. So, if you want to see anything WITHIN the inside of the park, you have to lock up your bike and walk.

It is composed by different parts, such as the great lawn, the reservoir and the Lake, and there are scattered here and there several statues or pieces of art. During our stay my girlfriend and I passed by or visited Central Park every single day, as after a long day of walking in a concrete jungle breathing some fresh air was lovely, and for a moment it seemed to be somewhere else. To visit the entire park you need several hours, if not an entire day, as there is so much to see and do, and sometimes it's nice just to relax and enjoy life. We spent a good amount of time reading the inscriptions by citizens on benches; some of them were sad because regarded dead people, some other made me smile because they were about people who fell in love in that spot.

I then realised that I had seen Central park so many times in films and games that I knew it before I had arrived in New York.

Whether you wander about, or jog, or sit and dream, or read, or rollerskate, or practise your music, or sketch or paint - it's just perfect. I fell in love with the Pond and the mirror-like surface reflecting the trees and sky. The statues of Shakespeare and Robert Burns had me mesmerized. Hearing their voices (at least dramatized ones!) was the icing on the cake, with the cherry too. Strawberry Fields, John Lennon's memorial, is a bittersweet spot full of musicians and weeping fans. My daughter and I always shed hot tears when we visit. I cried like a baby when I saw the Strawberry Fields in Liverpool, too. The iconic Carousel was renovated by Alan and Catherine Strook, of the famous law firm, and beckons to bring out your inner child. Take a ride and feel the wind in your hair. There are cycle rickshaws also if you are tired, costing $5 a minute. There are horse-drawn Victorias as well. The imposing historical statues at the entrances of the park are marvellously scultped.

The weather was nice and this place is great for taking pictures. We really enjoyed our afternoon here. Just be aware some people think they don't need to wear a mask because they are outdoors. I understand taking the mask off briefly to eat, drink or take a picture, but walking around without a mask really is not a great way to show respect to other people's health and well-beings. If those runners can wear a mask when they are jogging, you, of course, can wear a mask while walking.",Good place for a walk but be aware of people not wearing masks,BHUANG69,"New Providence, New Jersey"
