It is hard to walk through and not cry your eyes out and feel all the frustration that comes with it. It is important to remember, but also to come with a forgiving heart and leave with the purpose to heal the harm done. For me it is a reminder that we cannot fight amongst each other, we need to tear down the differences in religion, class and race.",Never forget... heartbreaking,Harry Steiner,"Morristown, New Jersey"

It is very humbling to walk through the museum and re-live that horrible day. I bought two books from the museum shop and also bought a DVD when I got home that the bookstore was out of: 9/11. It’s about two brothers who were filming a rookie’s training to become a firefighter. I my opinion, it is the best film documenting the timeline of everything that happened on 9/11.

We all bring our personal experience and recollections from years ago and I found it very interesting to see how the curators projected and architected the public experience. The most impressive element I found were a few of the docents who were either retired first responders or individuals who had direct connections to someone who perished on 9/11.

The National 9/11 Memorial & Museum,New York City,20-Feb,20-Feb,322,101,0,5,"As a real museum buff; someone who visits them all over the world, this was an awe inspiring place. The museum had managed to combine all of the elements from the previous attach, USS Cole incident, history of the terrorists and the three main attack sights, along with the airliner where the passengers tried to takeover the plane after the hijacking (flight 57 from memory). The exhibits were varied and plentiful, the extra pence fee of 26USD sounds steep, until you go inside and see what is there. The scale of the two building was staggering, the loss of life at just under 2800, was frightening. This is a must visit location, somewhere which everyone must go to, to appreciate what we have in the free world.

You can almost feel the pain of that day. The ""Day as it happened"" section really got to my wife and I. Be prepared to be emotionally dragged through the mill. You'll feel like you should look away, but at the same time, you're compelled to see the stories told. We didn't have the guided tour, so made our own way around. We spent around 2 hours there, but it would be easy to spend more time. We just struggled with the enormity of it all. Word to the wise, if you want to take a drink in, you can only take in water.

Seeing the names of those who had died during both attacks was very moving. The area around the memorial is perfectly maintained and the birthday of each person is marked by a rose or flag upon their name which was really nice. We went both in the daytime and evening to see the memorial, it is illuminated at night too.

The National 9/11 Memorial & Museum,New York City,20-Feb,20-Jan,129,122,0,5,"Visited at the end of January when there are less tourists and had a queue of about 3 people who were quickly dealt with. In turn, we could take all the time we needed at each section we visited. This place calls upon a raft of human emotions and challenges your perceptions of humanity. Be warned, it is not an easy experience. We spent a couple of hours making our way through the museum but could not complete the entire journey as it was just too much to absorb and comprehend. There are many things which are very tough to watch and challenge your thoughts about whether you should experience. We found it to be a profound and meaningful experience. A difficult topic that has been handled with respect. Unforgettable. My only negative is that I found it very disappointing with the number of people that felt the need to take photos in the museum. I am making an assumption as the individuals may have had some very personal connections to the items they were photographing, but the appearance was that there were many people taking photos which just seemed disrespectful. I appreciate that it is almost impossible to impose a ban, so set up designated picture taking sites for those who really need to take a photo.

Ultimately I decided this was a part of history that they needed to know more about. I think I made the right decisions. While they already knew of 9/11, they had lots of questions. Difficult questions and we talked a lot during our visits and the days after. The museum is very respectfully done. It follows before the attacks, during and later.

The museum is so moving its not the kind of tour that one takes and then moves on. It’s a very thorough recounting of the events of 9/11 and the lives lost. Regrettably It did appear the political correctness has influenced some of the narrative and displays- most glaringly the very generic display of the “cross” the appeared in the wreckage after the collapse and some white washing of the motivation for the attack- not just hatred of the United States but an Islamic religious jihad against infidels.

I visited the museum back in May 2015, however travelling with a larger group of people, meant I had less time to read all the information and take everything in. This is a fantastic museum. It’s so emotional, I was stood crying at many of the artefacts and stories playing throughout – it’s so very moving.

For such a large site set in the heart of a busy city such as New York, the site was deftly quite as if a sound barrier was surrounding the area. I found it quite emotional as I toured the location of the iconic Twin Towers and then went through the museum. If you were affected by the disaster, I would recommend you visit the memorial, if you weren't, I'd still reccomend you visit the memorial of to pay respect to those who died needlessly and to the brave men and women of the NYPD and FDNY who stepped up in the time of need.

I knew we had to come here as part of our time in New York and I realised it was going to be upsetting. I did spend the first hour or so desperately trying not to cry. On the whole, it was well done. Shocking yes, but it had to be. Much more was made of the attack on the Pentagon than I remembered at the time. I liked some of the recordings of the rescue teams - it really brought it home again how devastating this attack had been. I found it too emotional to listen to most of the spoken biographies of some of those who didn't survive. As you can imagine, the mood was very sombre and it was fairly quiet wherever we walked. We did not bother with the audio tour - there was enough information on boards etc without it we felt. I did not like the way people were taking photos. I felt it showed a lack of respect and a little ghoulish if I am completely frank. I was also less impressed with the way there were a number of personal effects on show belonging to those who had died and which had been donated by their families. The memorial outside was beautiful with names of all those who had lost their lives. The waterfalls gave a sense of peace.

The National 9/11 Memorial & Museum,New York City,19-Oct,19-Oct,4,3,2,3,"the museum ticket lines and audio tour lines are a joke. First, do not buy a Go City Explorer Pass. If you do you will have to go to the museum, stand in line forever to get your museum ticket. You cannot use your Explorer Pass to get a 9/11 Museum ticket so you can’t avoid the ticket lines. Don’t stand in line to pay $8 for the audio tour. Reason 1: It will take u at least 45 minutes if 10 people are in front of you. There will be one or two agents to deal with hoards of people. Reason 2: Those agents have to verbally explain how the audio system works to each person. this takes forever. Nobody appears to have figured out that it would be much more effective to have a rolling video tutorial off to the side. Reason 3: The batteries run out on the audio systems Reason 4: You have to leave your driver’s license or passport at the audio systems desk and they return it to u when u return the audio unit. i never let my passport out of my sight so this a deal breaker for me. They also don’t post this rule anywhere. you only find out about it after you’ve stood in line for eons. Definitely go to the museum. The exhibits are so well done. Buy an online ticket in advance.

The National 9/11 Memorial & Museum,New York City,19-Oct,19-Oct,12,29,1,5,"9/11 Musuem is well worth a visit. It takes time to go through the exhibition and to read and reflect on this disater. At the start of the tour you are actually below ground in the original towers and then this leads on to the exhibition. No photos allowed in the exhibiton . It gives the timeline of when the planes hit the towers and the aftermath that followed. It was eerily quiet here and people were visibly upset at times. You can visit the One World Overservatory and see the Memorials above ground at the same time. If there is a queue , note that there is ticket machines at the back of the musuem and you can purchase tickets and skip the queue.Being the daughter of a fire-fighter this musuem meant a lot to me.

The National 9/11 Memorial & Museum,New York City,19-Oct,19-Oct,131,26,0,5,I visited this site with a former collegue his wife and my sister. I spent 30 years as a Federal law enforcement agent and the effect on me was so intense that I was unable to complete the tour. On two separate occasions I was overcome with emotion over the mementoes and stories of indescribable heroics on the part of the First Responders. Having spent many years side by side with local LEOs and seeing things displayed such as the NYPD badge of a Patrol Officer who ran into the tower several times to rescue people and ultimately lost her life in the process or the Firefighter who when aske by his wife during a call to please come home safely told he that he woudl do his best but he had a job to do and he too never got out alive was for me more than I was able to continue to see that day. Others however were treating the area as though it was an amusement park taking photos despite signs stating that it was forbidden and posing for selfies in front of personal items of the First Responders. This is a must see piece of history and a stark reminder of what the result of ignorant blind hatred can be for the innocent.,Gut wrenching,Kyivguy,"Las Vegas, Nevada"

Once the tour is over, you are able to stay as long as you want and go through the exhibits at your own pace. The guide essentially shows you a portion of the museum and explains the significance of the artifacts there. We spent another hour and a half on our own, so I would reserve 2.5 to 3 hours for the museum total.

The National 9/11 Memorial & Museum,New York City,19-Oct,19-Oct,11,15,1,5,"One of the must visit places on your list while doing NYC. Extremely emotional and unsettling but hard facts of how devastating the act and day was for humanity and not just NY. The stories, small videos, voice recordings, original pieces of debris incl a young child’s shoes, a woman’s bloodied heels, smashed up fire truck, battered police car doors, badges, items of clothing.... the list is endless. The calls made from the airplanes to families and loved ones will make you tear up the most coz in that moment you can feel the fear, pain, uncertainty of them ever meeting the people they are calling and knowing this might be their last call is devastating. For me as impactful as the inside tour was, equally impactful in its own silent way was the outside area where the names of each soul lost that day is etched in remembrance - even with tonnes of visitors at any given point, the silence, grief and solidarity of people standing seeing the place is unmistakable. Really appreciate the gesture of the staff putting a white rose against the name of the victim whose birthday it is that day every single day before the memorial opens to public! This review would not be complete without a mention of how one knows that emergency rescue officers worked endlessly that day (and for months afterwords in the hope of recovering remains from amongst the debris) but the loss of life and the magnitude of their efforts is something I came to appreciate only when I visited the memorial - it’s beyond what words can express - true hero’s! A must visit but be ready for a roller coaster of emotions - it makes one realise how abruptly and unfairly life can come to an end - as angry as that thought makes one, it also hopefully makes people vow to be more humane and stand as one in solidarity and support against terror.",Roller coaster of emotions - must visit! ,Jags,"Toronto, Canada"

Walking around the memorial museum made everything seem unimaginable but I think its a must see if your visiting NYC. I would highly recommend to adults and teenagers but it's probably not the sort of place you'd take young children just because of the nature of the place.

One of the few places in New York where there is barely any talking. You're immediately overcome by the enormity of what happened and the size of the buildings from the footprint you walk around. There are audio and guided tours to take. We just wandered around and read the panels. I didn't even feel as if I could snap photos, didn't see anyone else either taking pictures. The huge open spaces carry on down as you walk into the very base of what was one of the towers and physically see how huge this awful event was. There are visual and audio recordings from that fateful day, and a wonderful museum within the memorial of private momentos of the living and dead victims. Very moving memorial. Balanced curation. Lots of silence as people exit. Only heads up - do it first thing in the morning before the thousands of other people arrive, and you can contemplate the enormity of it all.

Our last visit to New York was shortly after the attacks and we made the visit to Ground Zero to pay our respects and experienced the original museum space. We absolutely do not regret going but I feel like it is a good idea to warn future visitors that if it is a busy time to visit it is really hard to enjoy the full effect of the museum. We had a 2pm entry time and the line to get in was manageable but once in the museum the crowds were greatly felt. The museum is dimly lit and the exhibit signs are small and really hard to read when surrounded by large groups of people. There were many displays and signs that we didn't get to see or read because of the flow of the crowd. The majority of our time spent in the museum was waiting for our turn to see an exhibit. With that warning in mind, the variety of displays and information were well done. It was a somber and meaningful reminder of the sacrifices made that fateful day. We did not use the audible tour, maybe that would be a better way to get the information without having to read the placards along the way.

We purchased our tickets online prior to going so that saved us a wait in another line to get tickets. Be prepared to wait in the line to enter the museum as everyone must go through security. Once inside you have the opportunity to rent the audio tour headphones, but you can download the free app on your phone that consists of the same tour (bring your own headphones). The designers of the museum did an amazing job with the exhibits and artifacts that are on display in order to pay tribute to all those effected on 9/11. We spent 3 hours touring the museum and felt that even more time was needed in order to really appreciate all that is on display.

The tour guides are incredibly knowledgeable and can answer any questions asked. I'd suggest going to watch the movie in the auditorium before you begin your guided tour - it sets the schene with such grace.

Our visit however was completed ruined by one extremely rude member of staff around the cafe area. She wasn't serving drinks or really giving any purpose other than abuse. Since we are walking around constantly all day, my boyfriend's mum decided to descreetly take her shoes off due to sore feet (only slip on shoes anyway) under the table as she had a coffee. This woman decided to stand over and intimidate until she got our attention. She then asked her to put them back on which she did, as she was walking off she then decided to come back and started getting extremely hostile accusing me of giving her a funny look? She was extremely rude and attempted to intimidate and almost bullying me but I was just so confused as to why she thought I had given her a funny look? Either way her response was completely unacceptable. This is absolutely disgusting considering the emotional and sensitive nature of the exhibit. She then tried to make it very uncomfortable for us, giving dirty looks from across the cafe so we decided to leave.

Seeing the crumpled remains of a fire engine and some of the beams from the towers really brought home the magnitude of what happened.

You have to look carefully for the entrance since there is construcción in the area. And last but not least, there is this huge building that looks like a space ship that is a very mice mall.

Roses are placed on the names which have a birthday, surrounded by the trees of the memorial gardens. Very touching, spend time to reflect. What brought me to tears was the name of a lady with the words ""with unborn child"". The museum in dark wooden floors against the stark concrete of the WTC foundations and photos and excavated pieces of structure, fire engines, remembering those who ran towards the danger and gave their lives, including a small memorial to the rescue dogs, it appears as though no-one is forgotten. Spend some time sitting in the darkened room in the centre and listen to the stories of those who passed. The exhibits take you through that fateful day with sounds and video collages, ending with an area attempting to rationalise the reasoning for the attack. You will really need at least 3 hours or more to take in the museum and slowly make your way through the timeline. I would even say come back over 2 days. Very emotionally hard-hitting.

The one thing that really bothered me is how many people are smiling for selfies, flashing peace signs or some other hand gesture. The memorial should be treated with the same respect given in cemeteries and at funerals. It is not an amusement park! Seeing the pools looking so peaceful gives a perfect reference to imagine where the towers once stood.

It is a large area where the pools are located so there is enough room for everyone to see and pay their respects, Considering there were a lot of people around there was a silence around the pools which was very powerful and also very emotional. In side the museum the are various things that are from the twin towers, from part of the aerial from the roof to what is left of one of the fire trucks. There is one area which has photos of the people that were killed that terrible day and there are voices of their friends and family speaking about how they are missed or remembered, this room was very overwhelming. there is a gift shop at the end of the tour but you do not have to go in if you wish not too. When you arrive at the bottom of the building you can just sit for a while and try to take in the atmosphere and shed a tear for the ones that were lost, something I think most of us did that day.

I feel I could visit this museum 20 times and still never truly see or comprehend all of the exhibits. There's so much to observe, read, and absorb.

Not surprising the memorial is next to multiple subway stations. Unfortunately on this day, it was raining so we did not spend much time around the water cascade. Tickets were easy enough to purchase. I did find humorous that some people objected that you had to pay to get into the museum which made me wonder how in the world did these people think this museum stays open keeping the lights on. Moving on - the museum was easy to navigate. It does seem somewhat crowed initially, but the crowds thin out as you move forward. The museum does a great job reminding us of a painful story that should not forget. Reflecting back - I would compare this experience to the time I went to the Ann Frank Museum. I was aware of how quiet it was throughout the museum. This truly should be a must for all Americans to experience.

I’m not going to go into great detail because it’s something you really just have to experience it for yourself. I struggled immensely to hold back the tears (and I was 6 at the time of 9/11, not from the USA. I have no personal connection with the attacks but was so so so emotional at the museum) The museum itself is built around the remains of the twin towers. Tips 1. Don’t do the guided tour. (We didn’t and it was the right decision). We saw the tour pass and they went through everything quite quickly. We enjoyed taking our own time to go through the museum. 2. Go early in the morning. I found it was too crowded at midday 3. ALLOW TIME! Thank God we had nowhere to be afterwards because we didn’t expect to be there for 3 hours. 4. TAKE YOUR TIME! Read through the stories on the plaques. They are beautiful and moving. 5. Try to do it in the correct order - ask a staff member or volunteer but we went in one exit door and it put a lot of it backwards. I’ll just add too, we attended using the New York Pass which I highly recommend if you’re doing lots of tourist attractions.

Outside, two beautiful waterfalls, running into the foundations of each tower. Names carved forever more into the granite around it. I left the memorial actually feeling sick with the enormity of what had happened. I saw it live on television in South Africa when the second plane hit the twin towers second building.

Once we got in, we had to go through metal detectors. Quick and easy. It was not quick and easy touring the museum. On 9/11/01, we watched the horror of 9/11 unfold. Eighteen years ago we were working in FL, and stopped working when the first plane hit. We revisited in this museum what happened before that horrific event. How each act of terrorism unfolded. How heroic men and women reacted that day & in the days following. Ay one point, I felt the goose flesh rising & fought back tears. It was happening again, but not as menacing as before. This museum is a work of art. A testament to bravery and hope. A tribute to American spirit. It stands to educate the young who only hear second hand about what happened or learn in school about the events that changed the way we live. It is depressing as well as uplifting. The museum is something we wanted and didn’t want to experience. After touring, we needed a bathroom break; husband was in and done. For me, a lady, it was waiting time. Again. Five must be the magic number. Like other attractions, only 5 bathroom stalls. It might not seem important, but after waiting in line (30 min.) & touring the museum (90 min.), you don't want to wait. Again. But I did. When we exited, we walked around the grounds.

If you go downstairs maybe 10 minutes before the tour is due to start they have frequently have further tickets available to purchase. Another tip use the free cloakroom for checking your bags.

My wife and I went during Veteran’s Day Weekend 2019, and everything about the North and South Pool and the museum itself was haunting, especially when you remember the two great towers that once stood there. She and I both said we felt sick during the walk through the museum, especially in the special exhibition where photography wasn't allowed. Personally, there were a couple of times where I thought I was going to start crying while looking at the exhibition, especially the corner discussing those that jumped from the towers in an attempt to save themselves. They have preserved a lot of equipment (including entire crushed fire trucks) and have recorded personal stories. This is a must see for those that lived through 9/11, whether it was in NYC, or elsewhere. My wife and I were both in middle school, nowhere near the WTC, on 9/11. It is especially important for the generations born after, because just standing at the site and seeing the footage of what happened has its own sense of immense gravity that you can’t shake by walking away.

Oh and make sure you block out a full morning or afternoon of you want to do the museum properly. The museum is a strange layout. Wide expansive areas with relatively small amounts of large scale exhibits and two areas, directly below the infinity pools jam-packed with important personal stories and incredible exhibition pieces. Because of how much there is to see and how important the exhibits are in the smaller museum areas it gets very very busy. To the point you end up being jostled and jostling other people.

The National 9/11 Memorial & Museum,New York City,19-Nov,19-Oct,40,7,0,4,"Allow far more time than you would expect. If you want to absorb every exhibit, and read every placard, expect to spend two or three 8 hour days there. But don't do that. An impressive array of sometimes rather random artifacts of the event; which sometimes tells a story, sometimes doesn't. I was most impressed by the structural exhibits and the photographs before entering the main exhibit area. Near the end it gets a bit propagandistic in looking at the causes and gets a bit Islamophic, which doesn't really help much. Going into the personal lives of some of the victims brought home the reality, but at times seemed a bit voyaristic and I felt intruded on the lives of these tragic victims.","Worth Seeing, Just not Worth Seeing it All",Martin C,

I highly recommend the guided tour. They give you a set of headphones and you just follow along with your group. The guide was excellent and gave us plenty of time to ask questions. The tour was one hour. We had time after that to see the rest of the museum. It was intense. After seeing a couple of pairs of woman shoes, I had to get out of there as it was very crowded. It brings that day to life and every display was carefully thought out. It is a beautiful tribute to the victims. The initial entry was marred by a very rude employee. There was only one person collecting tickets. He stepped away from the door to show someone where to go outside on the plaza. I didn't know I was supposed to wait for him to scan my ticket. He very rudely yelled at me to wait. How about teaching your employees to have some customer service? If he is overwhelmed when someone by passes him by mistake and has to convey that by being absolutely rude as hell, he shouldn't be the first person you place at your museum entrance. It was an innocent mistake on my part and I didn't deserve to be yelled at. He could have at least told me he'd be right back.

The National 9/11 Memorial & Museum,New York City,19-Nov,19-Nov,470,309,0,5,"Visited on a Saturday in November. Pre-purchased ticket online which you can print out or download to your smart phone. highly recommend this. the ticket gives you a specific time (in 1/2 hr blocks) for you to enter. we bought 10:30am so could enter between 10-11 am. does not let you skip any line just controls the amount of people going through the museum but does prevent you from waiting in a purchase ticket line. while waiting to get in 90% of the line will be outside, so if going in winter be prepared. positive is the line moves quick, but you do have to go through airport security like checkpoint with metal detectors so travel light. they have many options of tours from an actual guide, to just an audio guide with headphones(rentals), to utilizing an APP you download to your smartphone listen with earbuds and go at your own pace. this was the option the 4 of us chose to utilize. it worked seamlessly as you can start and stop the description of what you are seeing at your leisure. there are definitely things that i think you will get from a live guide that you won't get from the audio only tour as i saw groups of people with guides stopping at certain points along the way that we had no audio to describe. however, if you are not a local and visiting from out of town and need a solid overview of the museum i recommend this method. the museum is overwhelming in both content and size. as with many of the other museums in NYC it would take you an entire day plus to look at every exhibit, artifact, display assuming you could handle it emotionally. unbelievable job incorporating pieces of the original structure left in place with newly created displays. we were there for 3+ hours and were emotionally drained. they also provide you several emergency exits to utilize should you become to overwhelmed by what you are seeing and do not wish to continue as some of displays are graphic/disturbing. they also have 3 or 4 displays where a live guide stands and gives you information about what you are looking at various intervals during the day. there were a couple of areas that got crowded as the area bottlenecks a little, but it doesn't last long. also have some areas to sit and rest as it is a lot of walking and standing. If in NYC not to be missed. Subway takes you right to current WTC and they have security outside of subway system in the current WTC lobby to point you in the direction of the museums and memorial pool. plenty of staff to assist you to let you know what lines to get into. a must see in NYC!",Emotional perfectly done remembrance of dark day in US history,bri11164,"Bridgewater, Massachusetts"

My wife and I are blessed to have made it alive that day with the building falling and chasing us for our lives. It was a day not to forget. We finally found the time to visit the Memorial Gardens and Museum courtesy of a friend who lost a family member and is a worker of the Museum Staff. She treated us to a visit that day several weeks go. It was a very emotional day to walk the area where I enjoyed walking around the Twin Tower and looking up at them. Even enjoyed going to the top of the WTC. So strange to see what they developed there but very happy to see the beautiful concept they designed. To see the falls were very peaceful and calming. To see the names of all those that were unable to return home that day. We even know a friend that her cousin passed that day and was able to visit it. Wish I had a flower to leave. We then proceeded to the lower museum to see this long awaited return to 911. Security is extremely strict before proceeding to the museum further. Phyllis our friend and worker, gave a over view before we ventured ourselves thru the history we once found comforting and pleasant till that day. What a wonderful job of telling the story and all the artifacts so familiar to us of the past. Many that belong to those again not with us anymore.

Upon entering the museum we were security screened and then Megan gave us about 10 minutes to cloak coats, visit the toilets etc before commencing the museum tour. The tour offered an insight into the construction and flaws of the original buildings as well as the architecture and geographical layout of the museum and the memorials.

Upon our arrival there was a very long queue. We were able to bypass this with our pre bought tickets saving us quite some time.

Then go into the museum and spend time wandering from room to room. The entrance desk did not try to push the audio tour on us at all, even saying how you can get it free or that you can just read the information on each exhibit. However, I was so glad we did get the audio tour as it really added detail, sounds and narrative, around each exhibit. There were certain exhibits which were very hard to look at / watch / listen to, but if it all becomes too much there are easy ways to exit.

The National 9/11 Memorial & Museum,New York City,19-Nov,19-Oct,549,91,0,5,"On a recent family trip to New York this was always on the list of places to visit. Whilst not your usual tourist ""attraction"" i feel it is very important to visit such sites to remind us of the fragility of life. On approach to the museum you obviously cannot miss the fountain on the site of one of the towers, giving an idea of the sheer scale of the where they stood. Once inside it is hard to miss the pieces of mangled metal, the police memorial and old paramedic and fire trucks and not be moved by them. There is hush throughout the museum which is very eerie but appropriate. The exhibitions focus on individual stories of victims, the heroic actions of the rescue effort and the other attacks on the same day. The fact the museum is in the bowels of the original towers is mind blowing giving a feel for the sheer destruction left behind. A must visit, not for enjoyment but for paying respect to those who lost their lives and the heroism and stoicism of New Yorkers to recover from the aftermath","Poignant, eerie, amazing..must visit",Andrew C,"Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom"
The National 9/11 Memorial & Museum,New York City,19-Nov,19-Nov,226,41,1,5,"There are so many stories being told here in the Memorial Museum. So many many small dramas taking place amongst the larger horror being played out on 9/11. There are almost certainly too many for any one person to take in but you feel you owe it to them to try. There is a threat of being overwhelmed by it all. In the middle of thousands of physical artifacts, pictures and recordings in a lab at the centre of the Museum they are still attempting to identify the remains of some of the victims. Then there is the aftermath of that day, being felt by those affected by simply breathing in the air polluted by the disaster. How do you present that to the world as part of the tourist route in New York City? My wife, son and I visited and did the 1 hour guided tour and were all impressed by our guide. A difficult and emotive experience calmly and respectfully told. I would strongly recommend doing that 1 hour before setting out on your own. When we did explore further the 3 of us walked together but eventually we were separated as we each followed different stories or themes. There are small stories and large ones. There are the facts and the emotional impact on those who lost friends and family. When we did eventually meet up again we were quiet. Our mood the same as it was when we visited Auschwitz 11 years ago. Two quite different events but similar in their recognition of the need for people to remember As we sat on some benches in the main hall downstairs we watched as a young couple posed for a selfie, smiling and laughing. We knew it was time for us to go",They all need to be remembered,Colin A,"Glasgow, United Kingdom"
The National 9/11 Memorial & Museum,New York City,19-Nov,19-Oct,5,2,0,5,"The museum and memorial are set in the existing WTA footprint, with the museum underground and the memorial pools sunk in to the rough footprints of where the towers stood. The museum itself is fantastic. Beautifully designed, with images, videos and pieces of the towers placed throughout, it is a very powerful experience. The guided tour is $20 and is a must. The guides are very knowledgeable and really tell the story of not only the day of the attacks, but how the museum and memorial were designed. Everything has a meaning. It last for 1 hour and covers the entire museum apart from the exhibit dedicated to the attacks, which is self led. Audio headsets are provided. The exhibit took us 2 hours to view and could have taken longer. It is very moving and contains images, videos and audio which some might find distressing, but is an integral part.

The above ground site has a rectangular viewing area with the names of the fallen engraved on the raining, a thoughtful touch! Entering the Museum area I used my iPhone to show the tickets and proceeded for the tour. About two hours plus should be adequate for a visit. The museum area is well laid out and all areas are well described so in my case we could take our time visiting the facility. I’m not sure how a regulated tour would handle that.

The National 9/11 Memorial & Museum,New York City,19-Nov,19-Nov,11,23,1,5,"We visited the 9/11 Memorial museum while we were in New York recently. I have visited New York previously but the museum was not built at this time so it was something different to do and a part of our 3 day CityPass we had purchased previously. Going in I honestly did not know what to expect. It was quite dark due to being below ground and the dim lighting, but it was so, so informative. As stupid as it sounds, it was only in the museum looking at the photos of the victims that it truly hit home that this was real. We see about it on TV and in the news etc, but standing and looking at the slurry wall and the original foundations and it's suddenly, very tragically, bought to life what happened that day. No matter what you believe happened, conspiracies or terrorism, innocent people lost their lives that day and there are a lot of moving tributes to honour those whose lives were lost on that tragic day. The museum includes parts of the towers that were salvaged including a pane of glass, still intact from the 82nd floor, a staircase used by survivors, a memory wall, damaged fire engines and much more. The museum is very thoughtfully put together and the victims are thought about and honoured throughout. The only thing i didn't agree with, was visitors being able to take photos. I feel this was a bit inappropriate and not the right place to do so. But this is just a personal preference.

Discovering that they place a rose within the names of those lost for their birthday, was touching and a sign that they will not be forgotten. Inside the museum, there is much more detail and exhibits. Unfortunately the queue for the audio tour was barely moving, so after queueing for 15 minutes and only 1 person getting the headsets, we decided to go on by ourselves. I regret that now, and I would have preferred to have done the audio tour. Having said that, there is plenty to read and see and understand without the audio tour, plus it's easier to move around the crowds. The museum takes you from the inception of the towers, being built, the history, the bombing and of course 9/11. There are many artefacts recovered from ground zero, and the personal items bring home the reality of the people involved on the planes, in the buildings and the emergency services. There's a separate section where the details, artefacts, recordings and videos are quite harrowing, and I admit to getting a little emotional there. It's hard not to. this may not be appropriate for young kids, that's up to the parents. It took us about 2 hours, and we didn't read/watch/listen to everything, I think to do so would make it 4-5 hours.

We also both downloaded the 911 memorial app (free) before we visited and took ear bud type headphones with us. On the day we arrived 15 mins before our allocated entry time and it was quite easy to find the right line for pre booked entry. There were plenty of staff around outside to answer questions. Once inside you pass through airport style security - you can keep liquids like bottled water though. At first it is very confusing with various tour groups, different languages, people getting headsets, lots of people trying to get their bearings etc etc. This is where the app comes into its own! You get a guided commentary which tells you where to go (clear instructions such as “turn to your left and look up”). Once we had the commentary going, we ignored everyone else and got on with “our” tour. The app takes you logically through the museum (I think you definitely need some sort of guidance - you would miss a lot if you tried to go it alone), giving information and background behind the exhibits, with the option of pressing for extra information, narrated by Robert de Niro. You can pause it, go back or repeat sections. Some parts of the museum have video exhibits so we just paused the app for those and then picked it up again. The museum tour starts at ground level and then takes you down. And down, and down. You are going to the foundations of the twin towers. I am normally quite claustrophobic and did feel a little panicky at the start when everything seemed very crowded, dark and disorganised, but having the commentary helped and I was soon engrossed in the tour and enjoyed it.

Be prepared for at least a brief delay for security screening (the same sort as you experience at an airport). Make certain that you use a map/guide for your visit, as it wasn't immediately clear to us how we should ""flow"" through the space in which the exhibits are located. The highest concentration of displays is in an area that is sort of like a small house inside a cave. The displays are tightly packed together and also dense with information (video, text and audio). It was rather crowded on the morning we visited, making it more likely that we were blocking someone's line of sight, or vice versa. Although the overall footprint of the concentrated displays is not that big, we spent several hours taking it all in. Beware, some of the audio and video offered (usually in spaces well off to the side of the main flow of foot traffic) can be upsetting (e.g., images of people falling from the tower, or audio of phone calls from victims to their family members).

Firstly even though we had city passes we lined up to swap these for tickets for over an hour in the cold, then joined a new line also outside to gain entry. It felt very theme park esk. It was grossly over crowded inside, having to wait for people to step aside so you could see exhibits and then again for the plaque that it refered to it. The main area was this huge vast space that had big steels etc in. Then at the bottom they squeezed in the timeline of the day all on one room with brief mentions of the Pentagon and flight 93 which was massively overcrowded, people were pushing each other or falling over each other where it was dark. I felt like they had all this space outside this room why did they squeeze it in there when this was the main focus of the museum. Really badly curated. If you have that many visitors give people time slots. They did have a room where they showed pictures of each person and a friend or family member read out a memory or what theu were like which i thought was really special.",A little disappointed ,jackier1901,"Kent, United Kingdom"

The National 9/11 Memorial & Museum,New York City,19-Dec,19-Jun,14,5,0,5,"When you travel deep, deep down into the 9/11 Memorial and Museum, one of the most striking things that awaits you is the display of thousands of pieces of differently-hued blue paper, each one an attempt by civilian artists to capture the way the sky looked on the east coast on 9/11/01. Then you realize that the papers are all affixed to the front of a wall that separates you, the visitor, from the remains of all the souls who perished that day. Soul crushing. I also really appreciated the opportunity to visit the room where the faces of all of the victims are displayed, as I know three people who perished that day in the Towers. I would advise that you not try to do this museum and memorial in conjunction with anything else. We went to Liberty Island, Ellis Island and the Memorial all in the same day, and it was absolutely numbing.

Nearly 3000 names of those killed on 9/11 as well as this killed in the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center. There are 343 names of guys I knew and some I didn’t know. I remember looking for one particular name and when I found it, I cried. Friends and brothers I’ll never see or talk to again. Please go and see this solemn place. Listen to the waterfalls.

The National 9/11 Memorial & Museum,New York City,19-Dec,19-Dec,14,6,0,5,"Once we got inside it was a very emotional and moving experience. There were a lot of people there but the place is huge so it's easy to move around to all the exhibits. The dining area needs great improvement in my opinion. All they had was basically a snack bar with high prices, limited selection, and little seating. We were hungry after spending about 2 hours walking around so this was a disappointment. I think they could make a lot of money if they improved on this. Also, BEWARE - don't be surprised when you get there with your previously paid for tickets with a specific time listed which you pick yourself online. We got there and it looked like a Disney World ride with zigzags of people waiting to get in. I showed them our tickets but apparently you can buy tickets the day of so a lot of these people just walked up before we got there and bought tickets yet there was only one entry line. This just doesn't seem right to me. We were on a tight schedule with only 3 days total in NYC and didn't have a lot of spare time.

The whole museum is so tastefully done, with nothing but respect shown throughout. I was reduced to tears again. My one and only minor gripe is the attitude of the security staff as you enter the Museum. This is the second time I have been shouted at, as to which security line I should take! It goes without saying that there is a need for the security measures in place, and I am happy that this is the case, but there is absolutely no need to be spoken to in such a manor, particularly given that this is a place of respectfulness and reflection. I know there is a high volume of visitors and they need to keep the lines moving, but this was first thing in the morning and it wasn't busy!

However, for nearly all of us, time makes memories fade. Either, you need to be reminded or, if you're young enough, you need to learn for the first time that evil does exist. There are an extreme few that will never have a reasonable acceptance of others. Some of those extremists would rather see the death of others, than accept that they have a right to believe differently. Beyond the petty arguments with no real substance that plaster today's headlines, the modern western world has real enemies and those who would see us fundamentally change our way of life, or see us dead. This is a fact. To deny it is to put your head in the sand and anxiously wait for you neck to be severed. The National 9/11 Memorial & Museum is a must see. It has been designed and presented with great professionalism and wonderful detail. It displays fact, pain, healing, hope, hurt, pride, honor, and respect. It shows the worst of mankind. And it honors the best of mankind. Use this gift to have real conversations about real issues and lessons for all of us to be better.

The best part was the silent room where is went through all the victims of the disaster spoken by their families. That is the most peaceful place in the entire world. You could see the actual steps the survivors took as they escaped. The twisted steel that took the impact of the crashing jets. It’s breathtaking. Such tragedy in one place but a beautiful place to remember those who fell that day. We went about 6 in the evening, waited about 15 minutes.

The National 9/11 Memorial & Museum,New York City,19-Dec,19-Aug,2,1,1,5,Very emotional experience for me. I am glad I saw it. New York is a special place and seeing this heightens that feeling immensely. Especially towards New Yorkers. The way they came together during those terrible few days is vividly portrayed here.

The National 9/11 Memorial & Museum,New York City,19-Dec,19-Dec,34,12,1,5,We got to site well before our tour and wandered around the grounds for an hour. We then took a guided tour of grounds - even though we had just seen many of the sites the tour guide's (Ryan) information made it so much more meaningful. Then it came time for our museum visit - part of the tour was to skip to the front of line. The line was huge given it was a Saturday and we were able to almost walk right in. As for the museum - AWESOME job by the folks that put it together. The $8 headphone rental was well worth it and worked perfect.

There were several names with roses placed on them and we learned that someone places a rose on the names of each person who would have been celebrating a birthday on that day. Lots of people there even though it was cold on our visit. Fairly long lines to go inside the museum but they were moving quickly.

There are places of silence within the memorial where the images speak for themselves and will not leave you with dry eyes.

Not only did the museum humbly yet truthfully represent the events surrounding 9/11 and the events of the February 1993 car bombing, but it did so with great narrative from Robert DeNiro (you can download the app and listen to the audio for free rather than paying for an audio tour/headset). The room with all the victims’ pictures in it and the room with the timeline of the events of 9/11 were emotionally moving, yet tastefully done. Three hours in the museum was insufficient time to see all I wanted to see. I highly recommend setting aside an entire afternoon (3-5 hours) to see the museum if you really want a full experience of what the museum has to offer.",You Must Visit This Museum and Memorial,shaminajoy,

We are both so glad that we bought this ticket that got us access prior to the actual opening time of the museum. It appears that the low ratings are in respect to the crowds and seemingly mazelike layout of the museum. I will say that I can understand how that could be a problem. Without our guide,I feel we would not have gotten enough history and information from a tour we walked ourselves and I also enjoyed that we had the entire museum to ourselves (group of roughly 35 people). It was very emotional at times, listening to our tour guide talk about the history of the towers and walking us through the timeline of the days events. With the tour guide, you get so much more information on actual storied from people that day that survived miraculously and others that were not able to make their way out of the buildings. This was our second trip to New York and we did skip this museum the first time around due to the crowded lines. I highly recommend the early access tour.

The National 9/11 Memorial & Museum,New York City,19-Dec,19-Dec,68,10,0,5,"The 9/11 Memorial is a must see if you visit NYC. Like so many horrible events, everyone remembers where they were & what they were doing when the Twin Towers fell. We purchased our tickets through City Pass and was able to skip the long entry lines and purchased the audio tour ($8) which I encourage. While everything is set up to be self guided, the audio tour gives additional insight and guides you along the way to the next stop. As a wife to a retired police officer, I know that his calling is that of protector and had this happened in my city, it could have easily been him in one of those stairwells that never got out. The overhead playing of the dispatcher dispatching units, squads, fire trucks and every conceivable aid, the stories of those that got out and those that didn't was haunting. A lone purse, badge, helmet, shoe reminds us that this horrible day happened to REAL people not some movie scene. There aren't windows, the lighting is dim, some areas don't allow photography and if people do speak, it's in hushed tones so be prepared to feel emotional.

The museum is definitely worth visiting, despite very long queues and not the most polite staff that tend to order and shuffle you about with not very clear instruction.

We arrived late afternoon but we're still able to see most of it after only a bit of a wait in line. We spent about 3 hours there. You could definitely spend more time there or just as easily less.

Having been 18years old when the atrocity hit the city I like others remember exactly what I was doing on this fateful day. We pre booked our tickets online before arriving and were able to skip the main line having done so. Once through security checks we had already downloaded the 9/11 mobile app and opted to use this version of the audio tour. It took you around the museum in order and advised of additional and optional sections of audio tour which could be listened to at different points. The museum itself was very moving and somber but full of information about the before and after of this atrocity and how New York and America rebuilt itself. We had allowed around 3 hours for this museum but found ourselves captivated by what was on display and spoken about, that we were there more like 4-4.5hours and that was rushing certain parts so please give yourself enough time to truly take it all that's to look at. This was a very informative and educational experience and even as a serving UK Police officer I can still not comprehend what those working that day in any emergency service role had to face that day and those days that followed.

Of course, the most poignant part is the area dedicated to all of the victims.

However, since the 9/11 attacks, we have wanted to visit to pay our respects to the place where we once stood on the 107th floor of the South Tower. As so many, I remember vividly where I was and what I was doing on the day of the attacks. I watched the whole thing unfold live on tv, I’m disbelief. I felt very emotional on our visit. The two pools, which flow in the footprints of the North and South towers are beautifully done. The museum is again, very well done. We downloaded the audio tour to our phones before we arrived. This saved us $8 per person. There is WiFi so you can download it once you are there. Allow plenty of time if you want to take in every part of the museum. We were there for 3 hrs and didn’t quite listen to every part of the tour and we didn’t watch the available videos. We were on a schedule as we had tickets to the hockey match in the evening!

For that reason it was first on our must visit list for New York. The two memorials are perfect and extremely thought provoking, not an easy thing to design. The 9/11 museum was actually extremely well done and very tasteful yet very informative. I thought it was a really nice touch that every victim’s photo was shown and you could click on their picture and hear friends or relatives tell you a little bit about them. You need to allow at least 2 hours for the museum as there’s a lot of video and info to read. We did buy timed tickets in advance which did save queuing and they did let us in an hour ahead of our allocated time too. I would recommend going as early as possible (opens at 9am) as it does get busy.","Must visit!! Excellent memorial/museum, heart rending ",Deanne,"Coulsdon, United Kingdom"

The National 9/11 Memorial & Museum,New York City,19-Dec,19-Dec,73,18,3,1,"I was completely shocked by how distasteful this museum was. I found the whole experience draining and upsetting. Placing handbags, shoes and other items found in boxes for people to look at, what is that all about. Showing images of people jumping from the building in moments of pure confusion and stress is awful. I know if Id chosen to jump, I wouldn’t want everyone gawking at my moment of despair. I honestly couldn’t believe how many people were taking photos of items. Who wants to be reminded of this horrible day by having photos on their phone. Each to their own though. Most of the other places we visited had free audio tours, not here, $8. You’re not allowed to take drinks in but you are able to purchase them inside. Initially thought this was for security purposes but then security let me in with 2 large bottles of water based body sprays, but not my water. Again, money making as there is a cafe inside. Then the icing on the cake, a gift shop!!! I know they claim that some of the money goes to the victims but seriously making money from something so tragic is disgusting and why would anyone want a souvenir. Our memories, thoughts and respect is in our hearts not in a bit of plastic or trinket from the gift shop. I think you’d be better off paying your respects outside by reading the victims names and donating the cost of your museum ticket, audio tour, gift from the gift shop and drink from the cafe to one of the charities that would benefit from it.",Distasteful ,Diana B,"Sheffield, United Kingdom"

As with anything in New York, we found getting to a venue upon opening to be the best way. The memorial and museum are both incredibly done. The memorials create a somber setting as you then proceed to the museum. The museum is well done and extremely daunting but informative at the same time. The exhibits and stories attached to them are just unbelievable. As a Police officer in Australia, i found it a fitting tribute to the emergency personnel who also lost their lives. You could easily spend the whole day there, but again, due to its popularity, I’d suggest getting in well before the crowds as it gets packed. My only complaint is there were many people who treated this as a tick in the box for their social media. Numerous selfies, walking past half the exhibits with their faces buried in their phones, and laughing at points, at videos where one of the planes impacts.

As someone who used to work near the WTC and passed through it every day, visiting the museum brought back a flood of memories of that time and the strong emotions that the attacks evoked.

The National 9/11 Memorial & Museum,New York City,19-Dec,19-Dec,860,265,0,3,"The hard thing about reviewing this ""attraction"" is to shoose whether to look at it from one's emotional experience or to look at it as a museum about the event. Of course this memorial is something every American should see as an event that changed the course of our country and of our democracy. The memorial fountains at the footprints of the two towers with the names inscribed of those lives lost, the tree which withstood the fires and was re-planted and the wreath are hard to see without giving rise to emotions and feelings about that terrible shocking day. If one is to young to remember, the timeline inside the museum is very helpful. But I felt the museum actually devoted a lot of space to limited exhibits although seeing the charred firetrucks was sobering. Not long after 9/11 I was in New York and sstopped at St Paul's Chapel which had a display I'll never forget of photos of the firefighters and others who went there to rest or sleep, the notes from those first responders, quilts, and other exhibits. I thought the museum would be an expansion of that but the museum's exhibits are vast but lost the poignancy of those photos at St. Paul's. The museum is certainly worth seeing, of course, but I thought a better job could have been done. Perhaps as there is more time since the event and historians and archivists have gained more perspective, the exhibits will be augmented.","Something each of us should see, difficult at times, timeline is good",CarolinaBecky,"Raleigh, North Carolina"

Now we are waiting in another line 100s deep for the 10 AM time we reserved (which has passed). If you happen to run into a guide they will tell you which line but no info given.

It is every emotional (bring tissues, you'll need them) while walking the museum, for which you should allow 2-3 hours to view. The museum captures the heroic actions of many, the panic, the sadness of the loss of so many lives.

The National 9/11 Memorial & Museum,New York City,19-Dec,19-Dec,2,3,1,3,"I booked the museum and memorial thinking it was just the two waterfalls which I’d visited before. I wanted to visit with my son and pay some respect. I didn’t realise there was now a museum and this was included. Firstly the two square waterfalls are a very fitting and respectful memorial to the victims of that day. These are free to walk around and you can see the names of the fallen and I think it is very tastefully done. I don’t really understand the museum part. Firstly the ticketing and entry process is a nightmare. Booking beforehand you still had to queue for ages to get a ‘entry ticket’ from your on-line ticket. Then come back later and queue for entry for your ticket time. I’m only glad it wasn’t raining and freezing cold. Secondly I think it is too much. The fountains outside are fine, charging people an entrance fee and making them queue up in the cold to see a few battered exhibits didn’t seem right. Also having a shop selling key rings and tee shirts just seemed totally wrong. Seemed like someone was making money and turning it into a Disney show. If there has to be a museum, it should be free. Unless the money is going to some very good causes and this should be widely published from the outset. All in all left the museum part a little depressed with the whole process and wished I’d never gone in.",Museum a little Macabre ,Richard G,"Milton Keynes, United Kingdom"

Don’t wait in line during your time like we and many others did, just walk right up to the entrance doors. The lines outside can be overwhelming and confusing. This package comes with a tour guide, we had Larry. They are a wealth of information and really help you understand every aspect of the building, history, events of the day and the recovery efforts after. You get an audio headset so you can hear your guide, even if you are not near them. There is so much to see and take in. The artifacts, the survivors stories, the history of the lives of those lost, the background knowledge of Al-Qaeda and the capturing of Bin Laden, and so much more. We spent 3 hours there, but if I were alone I could have spent the day there. We paid approximately $124 for 3 adults and 1 ticket was a military discount. There is a gift shop but we didn’t go in and there are plentiful amounts of restrooms. Absolutely beautifully done and a great way to honor those that lost their lives and those that gave their time to restore the area and preserve the items recovered. Also, you will learn about the hijacked flights, pentagon bombing and the bombing in the 90’s in the parking garage of the WTC. Just Do This!!!!! It’s completely worth it.",Worth Every Penny!

This is a very very well done museum that gives background to the attacks and also gives one of sense of what that terrible day was like. I remember watching it on TV and it was very sobering to recall this tragedy. My daughter is 16 born after 911 - this museum provided her with a very good insight as to why things are like they are today and why this was a watershed event.

We got just the regular reserved tickets. We showed up 15 minutes before our entry time and were inside within about 10 minutes of that time.

The National 9/11 Memorial & Museum,New York City,20-Jan,19-Dec,27,5,0,5,"At first, i really didn't know what to expect, and normally museums are not my thing. I thought it might be relatively small with a few items that were recovered from the scene... how wrong i was! The size of the museum has grown over a number of years, and we was in the museum for over 2 hours, and could have done much longer if we didn't have an itinerary planned. I found myself really interested in everything, but you could easily walk round at a glance in an hour or so. The museum goes underground to several floors, and takes up the footprint of the twin towers (i believe). The volume of data and items retrieved from the devastation is staggering, and the level of detail is extensive! It is emotional, especially the rooms that has messages from loved ones who were caught in the disaster, and the room that is completely encased in the faces of the fallen. So moving, and upsetting, but a brilliant way to remember them! My only issue would be that we had a city pass for this, but still had to queue up for tickets on the day - you would think getting the city pass would reduce the need for queuing, but most tourist attractions in New York seem to work this way for some reason. Also, in the museum you have the option to leave a donation, which a percentage goes to the families of those affected - this i am a little sceptical about, and i do hope this isn't a cheap way for the museum to cash in at this opportunity!",The perfect tribute!

The fact that your underneath one of the footprints also adds to the experience. I recommend the self guided headphone tour very affordable and adds insite and good information as you walk the museum. Make your reservations for the museum ahead of time as they sell out quick. And in addition to the museum reserve your tickets and do the observation deck tour in the new freedomtower. You'll never look at that place the same again.

We didn't need to read about the details, but it is very haunting to see the ""Survivors Staircase"", and the FDNY Ladder 3 wreckage. The exhibits were nicely done. The experience for us was more about reflection and a re-validation of kind of the day ""line drawn in the sand"". There was life before 9-11, and life after. Now everything we did, whether at the airport, museums, observatory tower, Broadway show, the Rockettes at Radio City Music Hall. All the ridiculous lines and security measures, all can be attributed to what happened on 9-11. It is sad to see the depth of evil on what one human can do to another.

I was in a different country from the U.S. and still felt the experience and the feeling of helplessness. I was also at the site of the twin towers a few months after. The Memorial and Museum captures the essence of the horror and fear of those people who survived the catastrophe. Those who haven't visited, it is important that you do - you will have more appreciation of life and the goodness of people around you - those who gave up their lives - firefighters/firemen and ordinary folks who gave up their lives saving others - as those in the plane that crashed in Pennsylvania.

I think we probably spent half an hour outside and then an hour in the museum. Obviously 9/11 is an event that is very vivid in most visitors mind which makes the museum take on a strong relevance to most visitors. It’s very easy to get to by subway from anywhere in downtown. We purchased our tickets at a kiosk outside and waited maybe 5 minutes to get in. I’m sure it’s probably more crowded in the summer. I would recommend to anyone visiting NY.

It was such a sad experience but a beautiful and tasteful place of a memorial site for the thousands maimed, injured & lost their lives. Completely wheelchair accessible as well. The only way I can describe it, is that the fountain felt like a never ending waterfall of tears, in remembrance of the loss at this site. I loved that it listed every name of the lost people, so they’ll forever be Remembered. We chose two names each & have vowed to pray for those families particularly in the coming year, as well as all the others too. I was deeply saddened at how some tourists were posing for ‘happy’ photos & acting like models-I literally saw a woman flick her hair in the air several times, whilst the man with her, took several photos of her posing in front of the memorial. I just did not feel their actions were appropriate but I saw several couples & families posing for ‘happy smiling’ selfies & pictures at this site. I thought it very disrespectful indeed. Don’t get me wrong - I took a couple of photos of the memorial site but certainly none of myself or husband posing merrily at the site were hundreds jumped to their death. It was a very moving place & the loss was almost tangible- similar to how I felt when I’ve visited holocaust sites in the past.

The foundations of the buildings, the videos, and the displays all evoke the powerful memories of the day and a sense of the scope of the event; the room with the pictures of those who lost their lives on 9/11 is almost overwhelming in how it personalizes the tragedy.

The National 9/11 Memorial & Museum,New York City,20-Jan,19-Dec,"2,415",189,0,4,"9/11/2001 was a horrific day, and Ground Zero in Lower Manhattan was at the forefront of all the atrocities that took place that day. The museum and park that was built in the years since is a start reminder to all of us, and something everyone should visit at some point in their lives. However, be prepared to spend a large amount of time there if you plan to visit the museum. Lines, lines, lines. We purchased a ticket online, which turned out to be a mistake, because if it's not from the actual 911 museum website you will pay more AND not be able to skip the lines. Bottom line, with those aftermarket tickets we spent 5 hours at the location until we were done with it. Of that 5 hours, we spent 2 in line waiting for our real tickets (and a time) and another 20 to get in at our appointed time. I don't think there's a way to avoid the line upon arrival, whether you buy tickets on their website or not. My recommendation: go there, hope for no line, and stand in it to buy tickets.If you go with someone else, you can take turns standing in line while the other(s) go visit the reflecting pools (which take about 15 mins to take in) (and quite impressive). Once you reach the front of the line, don't be surprised if you have to wait for your starting time (ours was 90 mins after we got our tickets!) So we walked around lower Manhattan until the designated time. We then returned and waited in another line to get in. Phew! Inside, you'll walk a museum cut into the same square footage that the twin towers were located. You can see the steel beams in the floor which made up the footings, and you can see the bottom walls of the reflecting pools that represent the exact locations of the buildings when they stood. Very impressive. Located around the museum are artifacts, pieces of steel, actual damaged vehicles used that day, the famous staircase, and a room dedicated to all the fallen souls with everyone's photo and sometimes a short video summarizing their regular lives. Touching. At the end of the exhibit are even rooms talking about the conspiracy theories about that day, which should be looked at more closely than you might think otherwise.","Powerful, but this is a Business - here are some TIPS",Rich G,"Acton, Massachusetts"
The National 9/11 Memorial & Museum,New York City,20-Jan,20-Jan,36,59,2,5,"Incredibly sensitively done, this is a vast subterranean mausoleum, surrounded by the slurry wall of the ""bath"" that the WTC towers were built within, and bookended by the vast cubes of the memorial pools. Around and under these sit the exhibition spaces, which are as fascinating and horrific as you would expect them to be. I found myself in tears at various points throughout, and often sat down just to reflect (the ""In Memoriam"" space is a good place to do just that, and is quiet and reflective). I spent six hours there, way longer than I expected to, as there is so much to see. It is, of course, emotionally draining, but well worth the visit. Go early to beat the queues - it was noticeably busier when I left in the afternoon than it had been when I went in, but still not packed. Apparently they do free entry one evening but having experienced that at other attractions where they get really busy I would recommend paying for this one to get it when it's quieter.

Having watched this terrible event at home on tv seeing all the pictures, damaged equipment it brought it all back, the museum from the entry point looks tiny, in fact it goes down 4 levels till you are at the foundations of the twin towers, seeing the “slurry wall” which was designed to keep out the Hudson River and remained intact! It is a circle of emotions throughout the visit, we were 3 1/2hrs and could have stayed longer, on leaving the museum we went over to the 2 memorial ponds which we saw in daylight they were a lovely tribute however in the dark they had a completely different effect on me, the lights in the pool created an effect of a never ending deep hole with the flow of water disappearing.

This whole site is tastefully done and giveone a true feeling of the shock, horror and sadness that 9/11 brought upon our nation. In the outer part of the museum you can see different aspects of the destruction: twisted beams, crushed fire truck, broken off stair cases. There is an enclave that has pictures of all those who were killed by the terrorists on 9/11 and other items of note. The inner part of the museum is another museum that details September 11th through video, audio recordings, and debris from the attacks. This part of the museum holds no punches and can offend the sensitive (No political correctness), and bring tears to most. This was the best part of the our visit to NYC. I do wish I had more time (I could have spent an entire day there). Lastly, there were those that were taking selfies and pictures of themselves (I saw one guy giving a thumbs up) in the museum (not the 9/11 portion). I found this to be in bad taste. Getting likes on Facebook (IMO) isn't worth disrespecting those that lost their lives on 9/11.","Very Moving ,Sad  but beautiful Memorial",Christopher B,"Houston, Texas"
The National 9/11 Memorial & Museum,New York City,20-Jan,19-Dec,1,0,0,5,"The Memorial fountains are very well done. Impressive living sculptures and very peaceful - even in NYC. The National 9/11 Museum has a lot of material and information that is for the most part presented well. However, you should research the exhibits and museum lay-out before visiting since the internal arrangement of exhibits is not well described in the museum. And we did not find a map until we were inside for 2 hours. Plus the map is more of a conceptual depiction of the museum. It was hard to find the actual main exhibit on the lowest basement level behind an indistinct door with a sign.",Very moving history museum,Stefan N,

Being a retired firefighter, a was working the night tour the day before 911. The Today show was on TV as I arrived home, and it reminded me when I was younger watching President Kennedy. We paid for the guided tour, and it was well worth it. There wasn't enough time in the day to see the whole experience. In ending, our department went to New York to assist in the recovery effort, and one of my brothers is no longer with us due to cancer.

All I could think of were the poor people jumping to their death and the first responders braving tragedy. And it doesn’t seem that the moment of their death is what we should be reminded of. Is that the message? That our lives and deaths are meaningless because we just end up swirling into an abyss? Then there is the fact that the memorial museum has an entry fee. Really?

As I had just visited 3 months prior, I didn’t want to go through and pay for the same experience. After waiting in line for 20 minutes in the freezing cold in line, at the gate I explained I was not attending and just would wait in the lobby. There is NO lobby to wait in, meaning they won’t even Let you enter the building without a ticket. Also they would not accept my NYCID which is supposed to be valid at ALL real museums in New York City. The staff was very rude, ill accommodating and literally told me I had to go outside in the snow as I could not wait for my family inside anywhere. WHAT!! Considering we just spend $56 that is super rude, and also not very accessible for actual New Yorkers who want to take their family and friends from out of town and have no option to even wait on them. Staff was horrible, treated us rudely and awful customer experience overall. Which is sad because the museum is really beautiful, but NOT accessible for actual New Yorkers to share with others.

Very impressive to see the US response in the short period after that attacks. My only criticism was that it was far too crowded. There didn’t seem to be any limits on how many people were being let in to the exhibition and as a result you could barely move through the crowd, and physically could not get close enough to some of the items to read them.

The museum is tastefully done but so moving and very sad. Hearing the voices of the people who passed and seeing all the artefacts left over. I used my City Pass so rather than queuing as I understand it can get extremely busy, you just follow the line for city pass and go straight in. You will have to go through security but this is common across other attractions in the city. I would say you need to spend at least 2/3 hours here.

Actually being there and having things explained to you about the museum and artefacts there was a real eye opener. So moving to see things that was there on that terrible day. I didn’t realise how much detail went into the memorials and museum and the meaning behind some of the bits. Just one example is in the attached photo, each blue Square was painted a different shade of blue to represent each person who lost their life that day and they also reflect to trying to remember the colour of the clear sky on 9/11 Could go on for ever about it but this is probably one of the best experience I’ve had for so many years.

The National 9/11 Memorial & Museum,New York City,20-Jan,20-Jan,29,6,0,4,Had a great time at the 911 museum. I just got the basic entry without a group lead or audio. I saw some groups with the lead.. very interesting concept. The group lead is speaking in a headset and everyone in the paid tour had headphones on listening to the guide. So not sure if the content was worth it but this was my observation. But as a self guided tour.. the beginning starts with an overview (pictures attached) then it goes weird. None of the next pieces of history are in chronological order so it's very confusing. Then you make your way down stairs and you don't know if you should go right or left.. so we went left. After some more artifacts from the evaluator shaft and a fire truck.. you see this room.. and there is someone by the door that tells you no pictures inside.. ok.. so now this is FINALLY the room with the chronological events in order.. it was hard to follow two sides bc you had to go down one side.. fight the crowd to go back to start over to see what you missed on the other side.. the room was way to small.. they had alot of wasted space out in the main part that should have been used to explain the most important part of the museum..but they didn't. Another thing to note is that you have to read ALOT and the writing is SMALL! I'm 37 with glasses.. poor old folks gonna have a hard time understanding.. BUT got the overall history of the events.. so it was a good experience and work the entry fee.. I would definitely go again!,911 Memorial ,Jess L,"Irving, Texas"

For those who live in NYC and as painful as it might be to relive the experience, I really think it will help to see how classy this museum was made and how they honor all of those who perished. I am disappointed in that the terrorists responsible were also a part of the museum. I’m sure when the museum was being built this topic was likely a hot topic as to whether or not to have them in the museum. For some reason beyond me it was decided that they would be a part of it. Yes they were responsible and a part of that day, but having them in the museum advertises them which is what their cause wants. Although I disagree with this aspect of the museum, the rest of it is well worth it. One piece of advice, give yourself ample time to go through the museum.

The water pools where previous WTC’ stood are a pretty spectacular feat in themselves. The layout of the museum, and the informative facts really do make you pay tribute to all the lives lost & affected by the attacks on that day and there after.

Also there is one area which is extremely upsetting of zoomed in photos of people jumping/falling out- not too sure that is needed. However, it is incredible to visit and I highly recommend. Memorial is beautiful. Visited in December after wanting to for years. The atmosphere when you turn the corner and see the memorial is incredible, really emotional and really takes your breathe away. Is really well done and the flowers in the names of peoples who’s birthdays it is was a really lovely touch. Spent a while walking around the pools and then visited the museum. The museum was extremely busy, in fact it actually spoiled it slightly as it felt like they’d let too many people in and you couldn’t fully appreciate each item and read the notice boards. Especially when it came to the section where you are not allowed to take photos and videos in- it has a lot of private items in there such as letters, audio and other items but you could not get close to appreciate anything properly. There were seatbelts from the plane as well as a window which was really interesting and upsetting. However, there is one part where there is a display of photos of people jumping/falling out of the building. Really took me back as the photos are so harrowing and zoomed in and a lot of people were crying so I would avoid if you are already feeling emotional. However, will say it was absolutely incredible visiting and I would love to go back when it is quieter to fully appreciate and take everything in. Highly recommend.",Worth a visit ,Liv,"Wales, United Kingdom"

Including the steel cross that’s famous from the photos, things like objects recovered from the buildings, radio messages playing from people on the planes and people in the towers. There’s even fire trucks in there that were partially destroyed. There’s really too much to list but I take my hat off to the people that put this whole thing together. It’s a must see place to see.

Entering the museum, I decided that I would need to take one of the guided tours to get the fill experience. Our guide (I forgot his name) was excellent! knowledgeable and giving the experience in a sincere and respectful way. One thing I would change was the fact that there were people taking photos within the museum. There are certain areas within the museum where there are signs saying not to take any photos, but I personally would have liked it to be a complete no photo zone. I personally did not take any photos at all, as I would have found it to be extremely distasteful, but this is for other people to judge, this should be a place of respect and quiet contemplation.","Sadly, a must for everyone",Christian S,

I am led to believe that the displays, and exhibitions, change periodically, so I will visit again at some point",Memorial and Museum,Phil P,"Henlow, United Kingdom"

The National 9/11 Memorial & Museum,New York City,20-Feb,20-Feb,8,3,0,5,This was strangely one of our favourite exhibits of NYC - it was informative even for someone who has done a lot of research in to 9/11 and watched several documentaries and it was amazingly moving. Sad that so many people were taking pictures inside which we felt was inappropriate however all of the exhibits were heartfelt and superbly put together to give a sombering experience of the tragic event and give thanks to all of the emergency services who worked tirelessly without care for their own lives to save as many people as possible. The rebuilding and dedication of volunteers was incredible but some upsetting stories too.,Amazingly moving museum and memorial to all those who tragically lost their lives,Chris B,"Epsom, United Kingdom"

Informative. Staff (I think they were all volunteers) were friendly and willing to answer any questions you had. There were also mini exhibitions within the museum including a short film and one about the service dogs of 9/11. This may be an obvious statement but it was upsetting, some bits more than others and I did have tears rolling off my chin at one point... my husband did mention there were tissue stations (I didn’t notice these at the time) but I’m sure you would be expecting this before committing/entering the museum.

It was easy to the tickets on my phone without printing. I got the ticket that wasn't tied to a specific time since I drove in that morning and wasn't sure when I would arrive. We were in by 9:30 AM or 10. It did not feel overcrowded. We bought the $8 headphone system which works great and has images that help you identify the spot where you should be when you start the audio. The narration and stories told were wonderful and made it an excellent complement to an already well done museum. The museum itself was comfortable to walk around. The free coat check was very helpful. They covered every aspect of 9/11, including the months following, the previous attack on the towers, the training and tracking of the terrorists and the way it changed life in the U.S. Since I remembered most of this stuff, I thought I saw everything I expected but still learned a lot that I didn't know before. It's very comprehensive for younger people or those who were in the U.S. during the attack. I appreciated the focus on the victims, first responders and survivors. It's really a museum about the people, and those stories are what make it so sad.

I bought the tickets from the ticket machine on the wall of the building which meant that i got to skip the queue as a result but at no extra cost. I did not opt for the audio tour as i never realised the extent or size of the museum. We went in the morning but the place did get crowded as it was school holidays. The museum is very tastefully put together with a mixture of art, artefacts and videos. The guides conducting the guided tours were so impressive. They were full of knowledge but spoke so low key that there were non interruptions to other visitors. There are some very moving moments as you go through the exhibits but there are tissue points located discretely throughout. The atmosphere is one of huge respect. My teenage son and elderly mother were exhausted and took a break from the exhibits and went upstairs for coffee and snacks while my father and i continued through the museum. You cant leave the museum and re enter later on. Although we spent over 3hrs there it wasnt enough time and our time there flew. I hadn’t availed of the cloakroom when we entered and i should have as the space became a little crowded and warm as we moved further through the exhibits.

We got there when it opened at 9:00 am, and by 11:00 am it was packed with people. Second thing. The map you get when you go in is not very good and, if you make the wrong ""turn"" (as we did) you'll be pressed for time - and space, as the various museum exhibits are fairly tight. When you get to the bottom of the escalator, go left. I'll repeat, GO LEFT. That's where all of the artifacts are exhibited - pieces of aircraft, salvaged emergency response vehicles, visual timelines, diagrams, videos, etc. Instead, if you go straight, you'll end up in the Memorial part of the Museum... which is mostly dedicated to the memory of those who died in 9/11 as well as outlining the physical location of the twin towers building site. This is an incredible museum; there's a huge number of artifacts and some very thoughtful interpretive displays.

So my advice is earlier the better. Checked in our coats free of charge. The whole memorial is so tastefully done and I would suggest going inside the part whereby it tells the events of the entire day first then look around at the other parts. This section takes the longest and when it’s busy it’s hard to get close to read the exhibits. Inside this section you can’t take photos but it’s a minute by minute account of the events. It’s soooo moving... there are artefacts, people’s memories and answer phone message from people who lost their lives... I spent 3 hours in this section alone. Outside this area there are other artefacts and the memorial exhibit of photos. This places is a memory to all those people. If in NYC why won’t you go??? The water memorial is peaceful and moving and if you see a white rose on someone’s name it means it’s their birthday. A local florist has been donating flowers for this purpose every day since the tragedy. There is the surviving tree that was buried for months before they discovered it and sent it to a nursery to be nurtured back to health that’s there with a little fence around it. There is also the globe statue that was in front of the world trade centre in a park opposite .... we discovered wheel chair access after we lifted a mobility scooter up three flights of steps!!!

For me, 9/11 is one of those things you learn about in history class, like the Vietnam War or the fall of the Berlin Wall. This museum really brought the events of 9/11 to life and made me realize just how recent it was. There were a lot of accounts of the day and a whole room of pictures memorializing the event and people who died in it. The only thing is, it seemed like they were operating under the assumption that you remember the day it happened and what things (like airport security) were like before and after the event, so there were some things that they didn't explain.

The National 9/11 Memorial & Museum,New York City,20-Feb,20-Feb,8,2,1,5,"We visited on a sunny day in February. We traveled by subway from our hotel on W 57th to the Courtland St Station which is only a half block from the museum entrance but we first made a short detour to visit the Oculus, the transportation hub adjacent to the site - it is a remarkable architectural achievement and worth a look. We purchased our timed entry tickets online for a noon entry so we explored the memorial garden and pools first. At 11 we walked to the museum and found that since January and February are slow we could enter early. We had no line but there was a short line for people who needed to purchase their tickets. I had downloaded the museums app to my phone ahead so we did not sign up for a tour (an extra $20 per person). The narrations on the app are comprehensive and well worth listening to as you walk through the museum. Remember to bring your earphones to use the app. The design of the space is incredible - you slowly descend ramps learning about that terrible morning until you reach Memorial Hall, a hugh under ground space at bedrock 70ft below street level. Most of the exhibits are on this level and you will also see the footprint of the Towers and exposed sections of the slurry wall. There is a small cafe with limited seating - it was not crowded at 2pm. On the cafe level there were two films showing. You cannot leave and re-enter the museum so plan accordingly. There is a free coat check. We left close to the 7pm closing time having spent almost 8 hours, including a 1 hour lunch break in the museum, listening to the narrations on the app, reading, viewing, There were plenty of places to sit and either rest or contemplate your surroundings.

The National 9/11 Memorial & Museum,New York City,20-Feb,20-Jan,36,19,1,5,"I visited the 9/11 memorial in January 2020 on my first ever visit to New York and the United States altogether. As an Englishman who was only 4 at the time of the attacks, my knowledge was very basic, knowing the general attack but not knowing the events behind the scenes and individual stories happening before, during and after the attacks. I entered the museum just after 9am, meaning that there was only a couple of people already there. If you wish to take photographs, I'd recommend going this early, however, be aware that no photographs are allowed within the exhibitions. The atmosphere was extremely eerie, with the sounds of survivors tales and news reports providing a background whilst walking through the main part of the museum, containing things such as the survivor stairs, the last column and a crushed fire engine. Then there's two main exhibitions. The exhibition dedicated to those who died (I didn't feel comfortable visiting this) and an exhibition disecting each part of the attack, with artefacts, photographs, videos and audio providing an in depth retelling of the events that day. One part in particular that stood out, was a slideshow of photographs, showing victims of the tragedy jumping from the upper floors of the towers. In areas such as this, there are warnings for disturbing images and tissues available. Also, whilst I was there, there was a special exhibition about the rise and fall of Al Qaeda and Osama Bin Laden. It showed the intelligence working to find him, culminating in a breakdown of Seal Team 6's successful attack of Bin Laden's compound in 2011. I would recommend visiting the museum, as it is an amazing learning experience, whilst holding a lasting memorial to those who died that day, with stories inside the museum and the reflection pools that inscribe the victim's names in the places where the twin towers once stood.",Absolutely surreal.,CallumBradfield,Sunderland

We saw a long line and decided to do on line tickets then found we’d purchased tickets to the wrong place. This is the main 9/11 Memorial and Museum with artifacts etc. from 9/11. I’ve visited the site over several years watching the clean up and development of this tribute. While I wish it didn’t have to have been there in the first place, it’s been done extremely well and it’s a truly emotional experience, especially the memorial walls of photos of people lost. So sad. There are so many artifacts that make you take a deep breath when you see the destruction that took place. Fire trucks demolished. Pieces of the very well known frontage that looked like a skeleton of the front of the building. You don’t realise how tall those were until you see them. We spent over 3 hrs there and could have stayed longer. You need at least 2 hrs. There’s a lot to get round and you can always take a break in the cafe upstairs. If I had to make any criticism at all it would only be that at times I wasn’t sure which direction to go because you go in an area and there are several routes you can go off to look at things. A minor point really and probably if I’d done the guided tour it might have helped.

It is visually stark yet beautiful, allowing visitors to shape their experience with as much or as little information as they choose, whether you watch the flowing water and read the names, or you seek out additional information that is available. The flowing water provides a quiet background of white noise and as it spills into the void of the footprint of the towers, it evoked a devastating sense of emptiness and loss yet allowed imagination of what may be beyond this world. The museum was very well designed and informative. The ability to exit quickly from areas that were overwhelming was a very good feature, along with signage warning that content of certain exhibits would be disturbing. Having watched the events of that day unfold live on TV like so many others, the exhibits filled in the background of those who perished as well as survivors. It brought a sense of grief as well as connection and admiration for those who helped others, were first responders, lost loved ones, and worked at the site to recover and clear the area. I traveled to the city a number of times while the site was being cleared and the memorial was being constructed, and was overwhelmed by the magnitude of the effort to recover from the great tragedy and destruction. I was so moved by this place and recommend a visit to always remember.",Incredibly moving and beautiful,Martha G,"Chicago, Illinois"

Museum lighting is dim to dark at times and with good reason to me had a heaviness about it. Imagining the horror of the victims is unsettling. Footage playing of the attacks on the towers was chilling. I remembered the day and what u was doing at the time of the attacks. I did have mixed feelings on the museum and how the loved ones may feel different emotions as they viewed what I was seeing, through very different eyes. Is it a tribute a gravesite or a memorial? I think everyone takes it differently. So to review this may be unfair. I think it is personal to everyone. Sad that it has to be there in the first place. With all that said it is a part of history and many lives lost and people affected. To not recognize that would be disrespectful. I wouldn’t recommend for children not directly involved in this Tragedy, to view under age of 12.",Mixed Emotions,skduwyn,

For people who remember that day, who lived it, this can be difficult at times. I had to text my husband about where he was as my daughter and I were sharing our memories of what we were doing.

Our guide was a charming lady called Judith who was a native New Yorker. Her tour was excellent, so informative, but also passionate. Having watched the atrocity itself unfold on television in London in 2001 it was sad,but also inspiring to see how not more people lost their lives on that tragic day but how resilient the New Yorkers are. I lived across the Street from the Twin Towers in 1984 and would walk past them every day on my way to work. For those iconic landmarks to have crumbled in such a way is a tragedy. However, visiting Ground Zero recently I can only congratulate New York in how it has recovered. The new tower is amazing and is a great tribute to its forebears.

The National 9/11 Memorial & Museum,New York City,20-Mar,20-Feb,17,6,1,5,I had visited the site of 9/11 on a previous visit before the museum had opened. I was a bit apprehensive about going as wasn’t sure how they could have presented a museum in a sensitive way. It was really worth going and we were there a long time. It’s quiet and respectful but very informative. Also the way it is set out you don’t have to see or listen to things you don’t want too. I think they have done a good job and I think this museum will be very important to ensure that generations in the future remember the significance of that day to all of us.,Sensitively done ,Heup,

Access was easy - no queue. The tour was led by a really informative young guide who was terrific. We all had headsets so she didn't have to shout and we could hear her even if we wondered a few yards away. It took an hour and then we spent about another hour there on our own. The whole museum and the tour is really well done - respectful and informative. I was so impressed.

The National 9/11 Memorial & Museum,New York City,20-Mar,20-Mar,60,57,3,5,"What an emotionally charged place this is. Outside the museum are the memorial fountains to honour those people who passed that tragic day, this had my wife in tears and me with ""something in my eye"". The museum itself is a fantastic tribute to the events of 9/11. It's is as you can imagine an emotional environment. There is the memorial hall with a photo of those people who deserve to be remembered with an additional area where the families have recorded messages about their loved ones. I am not going to spoil the museum for those who want to visit but please take plenty of tissues and be prepared to get a lump in your throat and that ""something in your eye"". Oh you can also download the 9/11 museum audio guide to your smartphone but have it turned really low or use earphones as I was asked to turn mine down by an abrupt individual member of staff.

The National 9/11 Memorial & Museum,New York City,20-Mar,20-Mar,125,45,2,5,Last time we were in NYC the national 9/11 museum was not open yet. We bought tickets at the machine outside and were able to go straight in early afternoon mid week. From the outside the footprint is not large but the building has multiple levels down to the foundations of the WTC 1 & 2. We were tired and need more time to full appreciate all the displays. The best part was the volunteers or staff telling there personal stories and describing some of the displays. Great displays handling traumatic subject matter with minimal flag waving.,Great Museum - Give yourself Enough time,Goriders99,"Calgary, Canada"

The National 9/11 Memorial & Museum,New York City,20-Mar,20-Mar,152,40,1,5,"This was an emotional one. We opted for a guided tour which I can’t recommend enough - our guide was Nanty who was fantastic. We were a small group but she allowed up to move through at your own time, explaining each exhibit as we went. It really was one of the most moving things I’ve ever done, 99% of the people were respectful and there was a eerie silence falling over much of the space. The lay out and construction of the museum has been done with thought and consideration, all culminating into an immersive experience. There are two extra exhibits but due to our poor timing we didn’t get a chance to visit. Please plan for at least 3/4 hours if you choose the guided tour which I would highly encourage you to do. You learn about personal stories, both those of survivors and those whom lives were taken. I couldn’t recommend this highly enough, it’s emotive yet respectful.

Tens of thousands immediately affected by the loss in their business or their family or their leadership. For instance, the firetruck that is twisted damaged (?engine #5), that had finished an overnight work shift and was off for an hour when the chief saw the fire. He called everyone and everyone loaded up and went to the fire. the engine company had been around for nearly 100years. Numerous generations of firefighters had served on the same engine company. Everyone on that truck died that day. It was, literally, end of the line. I was moved by the stories, by the photos, by how BIG it was. I experienced every emotion I have: joy for those who were saved, courage for those who countered the terrorists and crashed their plane into a field (losing themselves, but saving so man others), anger against the terrorists, sorrow for those who perished, and wonder of the beauty of the artwork that shows we will continue on.",Understanding the Event,Adam Bright,

The National 9/11 Memorial & Museum,New York City,20-Mar,20-Mar,85,56,0,5,"Our first ever trip to New York, a five day visit. We both agreed we somehow felt duty-bound to make the 9/11 museum our first place to visit. It’s hard to describe how stunning this museum is - in design, content, sensitivity and atmosphere. The collection of exhibits, displays, photographs and audio/video playbacks makes for an almost overwhelming visitor experience. A beautiful balance of commemoration of the victims and tribute to all those who played a part in responding to the attacks. If you’re ever in New York and have time to visit only one place, please visit this museum. And if you haven’t got the time to spend a couple of hours in the museum, then try at least to visit the plaza outside the museum, where there are two pools and waterfalls sited at the bases of what were the North and South towers, surrounded by walls on which are inscribed the names of all those who lost their lives in the 9/11 outrage. A few hours after our visit, in midtown Manhattan, we got into brief conversation with a FDNY firefighter who was holding pedestrians back while an engine was reversing into his station. He told us that of the 443 firefighters who lost their lives on 9/11, 15 were based at his station. I reached out to pat him on the shoulder and tried to say, ‘Good job’ but just choked up. So he patted me on my shoulder! Whether you believe in religion or not, the WTC 9/11 site is a sacred place and we felt sad and honoured to have walked there.",Moving and wonderful in equal measure.

We paid around $45 for the audio tour well worth it so you know what you are looking out and story behind it. Arrived at 9am to no queue and venue has a cafe as well and cloakroom is free to store heavy winter jackets and rucksacks (note that I had a thermal on and top and was quite cool walking around). Young lady who took us around was very informative and explained about everything well worth the extra as otherwise don’t think the exhibits tell you much. 8 of us on the tour all felt it was well worth the extra. This tour was just inside though you can pay to be shown around the outside too but we did 9/11 survivors museum tour where an actual person affected by that day takes you round $35 and Chris our guide was on the 82nd floor in North Tower when the first plane crashed into 93rd floor. Anyway back to the museum. After the guided tour you make your own way into the story of 9/11 about the whole day from start to finish including the terrorists and people who lost their life’s and the lessons learnt from terrorist attack in 1993. Very very interesting. Also a bit about rescue dogs but we didn’t do that as 3 hrs in we had read enough.

The free admission to the museum started at 5:30 pm. I was really surprised at how many many people came and from where they came from. There were really so many foreign tourists there to see the museum. It really brought back so many memories of that day but also showed so much more detail that we had never seen or heard of before. There were recordings of conversations from the passengers on the flight that went down in Pennsylvania as they discussed how to overcome the hijackers, accounts from first responders, from people who were in the towers. There were exhibits of remains from the building, the recovert equipment, artifacts from survivors and victims. It really was a lot to take in but definitely worth the time. We thought that the museum would be closing at 9 pm that day but it turned out to close at 8 pm.

There is so much to see and so many personal stories and information that make this living exhibit quite a moving experience. I was lost in thought the whole time I was looking around on my own for a number of hours before our group came back together before leaving. Your are actually at the location where something that changed the whole world happened and the whole experience in my view has done justice to those that lost their lives at the same time as reminding the rest of us who visit what was lost on that day.

There were some heartwarming & meaningful tributes, but the majority was gaudy, garish and tacky.

I was moved to tears both outside amongst the locations of the towers and throughout the museum. Out of respect I felt I couldn't take any photos within the museum. To me it wasnt a tourist destination for selfies and poses and memories, but a time to remember that fateful day and the horrors that America went through, particularly New York. Seeing items belonging to victims and damaged vehicles and pieces of buildings brought the images I saw in 2001 to life. I cried that day and I'm not ashamed to say, I cried all the way around that museum. Sadly some people were disrespectful, one man stood on a bench (a surviving one from the plaza) to take a photo. The staff quietly asked him to get down. Unfortunately, likes and shares have created selfishness in people. I wouldn't have a go at anyone taking photos down there but some forget that this place is basically a mass grave. I would recommend a visit and dont be ashamed to get upset. It's amazing how many people were. The only part of the museum I refused to acknowledge was the part about the terrorists. I did not care about any information about them.

I felt it was time for my teenage kids to fully learn and see what happened on that terrible day, as well as the heroism, acts of kindness, and patriotism that existed in the days, weeks, and months afterwards. They’ve done an outstanding job at the museum! Everything is well laid out and well documented. From the construction of the Twin Towers, to their role as a symbol of economic power in the US and NYC, to the events as they unfolded on 09/11/01, including the Pentagon and Shanksville, to the rescue and recovery operations and the clean up of Ground Zero. There is a section detailing the 1993 WTC bombing as well as the capture and trial of those responsible. There is also a section detailing the plot against the USA on 9/11 and the capture of Osama Bin Laden. One of the most moving parts for me was the photos of all of those lost. There is also a section where there are videos of the attacks and the Towers’ collapse as they happened on that day. I found this to be a very emotional experience!

When we visited, it was extremely crowded so you needed to be patient if you wanted to be able to read all the plaques. This crowd didn't bother me, it meant there was a building full of people who were showing their love, appreciation and patriotism for this country and the ones who lost their lives. This museum was so professionally and beautifully done, i cried the moment i walked in the door just knowing i was about to witness for the first time in person so much from that day. There were so many items from that day such as firetrucks, old building pieces, articles of clothing, office supplies, etc. There were recording you could listen to of the dispatchers, fire fighters, and civilians. To me the best part was also the most heart wrenching...a room full of digital photos showing all of the people whom had lost their life that day. There were a few tables that worked as tablets that you could scroll through those people, click one someone and read about their life before that day and where they were in the/how they were involved in the devastation. Even typing this sends chills down my spine and puts a tear in my eye thinking about all of this. The museum was so beautifully done, was so tasteful and respectful to this event and pays tribute so well. If i can convince myself to be ok with crying for the entire day, i would definitely return just to look at the same things all over again, and i know there will be somethings i missed.

Of course you can enter the park and wander, but way more interesting is to book a walking tour through the Central Park site. The fees are reasonable, you learn a lot and part of the fee goes right back into the park. In Central Park there's a Carousel, an Ice Rick, a Boat Basin, a Childrens Zoo, Playground, playing fields, rocks so smooth you can slide down them, promenades, quiet pathways. So much. The tours will really enhance your visit.",To truly appreciate the park take one of the  Central Park  Walking Tours,cjyap,"Griswold, Connecticut"

Check the sights you want to visit, I really enjoyed the Bow Bridge, The Lake, Bethesda Fountain and Terrace, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Reservoir, Belvedere Castle, Sheep Meadow, Central Park Zoo and Wollman Rink. I did not like the horse-drawn carts, besides mistreating the animals, they make a lot of dirt (feces) and as we were in the summer (July 2019) the smell was unbearable.

Central Park,New York City,19-Oct,19-Oct,209,83,0,5,"Absolutely loved Central Park. We went to the park on 3 separate occasions whilst staying in NYC for 3 different reasons. 1. We did the tourist Bike rental tour. This was a good orientation of the park for future visits and gave us an understanding of the size and layout. I'll review the tour separately, but safe to say worth doing. There are a few bike rental companies that do tours, and they are all fairly similar. Do this first! 2. I got up early and went for a run around the park (on my holiday!). The total perimeter is about 10km (I think) so if you are staying close it's a decent trip to run around the main road that goes approximately up one side and down the other. Early in the morning is a great time to see the park and with plenty of other people running, walking or dog walking it's very safe. 3. We went back late in our trip and just wandered through the Rambles. This portion is on the maps and a great place to get lost in. Bridges, streams, waterfalls etc. Highly recommend it. Grab an ice cream or even a Prosecco from the Tavern. The one thing I don't recommend is the bike or horse carriage rides inside the park. If you can walk, then please do, so you can get off the road and actually see the inside of the park.","Great use of Space, spend some time exploring.",Don B,"Sydney, Australia"

You really need a couple of days to see everything that's there. Our group of 5 started at the north end. We stopped at the Charles A Dana Discovery Center which is one of several visitor centers. We got a map so we could locate the sights more easily. We also viewed Harlem Meer, which is a lovely lake, from there. Then it was on to Conservatory Garden which is divided into 3 styles - French, Italian, and English. The flowers and fountains were just beautiful. We saw several wedding parties having their photos taken in the gardens. Limited to the afternoon, we exited the park and took a bus to 79th Street and then re-entered the park to see The Belvedere Castle, King Jagiello's statue, Shakespeare Garden, the Swedish Cottage and The Lake where many people were in row boats. We passed Strawberry Fields and went on to The Mall where there was so much going on - music, skating, dancing, and then saw the Dairy Visitor Center. We didn't touch on so many points of interest.

We jumped on the hop on/hop off bus that was going round Harlem then when we got to Central Park decided it would be lovely to wander beneath all those beautiful trees. It truly is paradise - you don't even hear the sounds of the city surrounding the park. We initially thought about visiting the New York Metropolitan Museum but the queues were way too long & not conducive to standing in the heat! So we spent several hours just wandering round the myriad of paths that criss-cross the park - watching turtles in the lake, squirrels scurrying up and down the tree trunks, we sat on one of the many, many seats to rest, listened to a wonderful jazz trio entertaining a handful of people under a huge tree & we cooled ourselves with an icy drink at the Loeb Boathouse. Absolutely not to be missed is the Bethesda Fountain & Arcade. The Arcade's ceiling is lined with the most beautiful Minton tiles and if you're lucky there will be a talented busker singing their heart out in the wonderful acoustics.

He was a very talented musician, The Alice in Wonderland bronze sculpture, the views of the high rise flats on Fifth Avenue, the Boating pond where you could hire a yacht to sail for half an hour and the beautiful foliage and acorns - complete with grey squirrels- in every corner of the Park.

If you are looking for solitude, this is probably not it. If you are visiting one of the nearby museums ie the MET or the AMNH, its a nice place to get some fresh air after a day of exploring the museums. I can see why this park is so cherished, its the largest green space in the concrete jungle.

We inhabit areas that are meant to separate tourists from their wallets and we are safely inoculated from 99% of hype and jive.

He knew how to stop, and take up the whole street, and when to bypass the runners, walkers, carriage drivers, and other cabs. It was clear to the other vendors that he was going to politely dominate whatever territory he wanted, and they were not going to move him if he wanted to be in a particular spot.

Central Park,New York City,19-Oct,19-Oct,51,40,0,4,"First, let me say, the only reason I rated Central Park a four instead of a five, is because of the Pedi-Cabs (that's what I call them). The second we stepped on the property of Central Park, we were attacked by the drivers. Each driver had a different deal/quote. There were three of us and, of course, they knew we were tourists. We did decide to go with one, since we had never been to Central Park before. The driver did promise certain areas of the park----some though, we never saw! When he said ""an hour"", it was exactly that! We paid way too much for what we got with him. I tipped him very little at the end because I knew he wasn't showing us what he promised. BUT, Central Park is very beautiful and it is a lot larger than what I expected. The day we were there, the temp was just right. We had sunshine and it was somewhat cool. Very nice. We found the park very clean. The park was congested with all the carriage rides, ALL the pedi-cabs, the runners, the bikers, etc. There were several wedding photo shoots going on the park as well. We were there on a week day---could not imagine what it is like on a weekend! We did enjoy ourselves and took a lot of pictures. I would like to go back and just explore on our own without the hassle of telling every Pedi-cab driver, NO. We were asked so many times again after our ride. I know it's a business, but enough is enough! Other than that, I would recommend to anyone to go to Central Park if in New York. Try to plan for at least a half of a day to really enjoy.

Central Park,New York City,19-Oct,19-Oct,12,2,0,5,"I have been on several walking tours in the 160 year old Central Park during the past decade. My favorites of course, are during the Autumn months when the foliage turns colors. The design & lay-out of the more than 750 acres of land was the result of an 1858 competition and created diversified sections that include walkways, bridle paths and roads for vehicles. One can view sweeping meadows, a grand elm-lined promenade -- the MALL and beautifully landscaped vistas. I think that one of the most beloved icons in the Park is the marvelous two-tiered esplanade at Bethesda Terrace - facing the sculptural fountain (one of 7 ornamental ones) where artisans play music, sell drawings and paintings etc. During the appropriate seasons, one can partake in sports such as swimming, row-boating, baseball, tennis and ice skating (2 rinks) - which I enjoyed so much, as a teen, in the 1960's. One of my favorite sections is the North Woods - where one cannot even hear the din of the City. There are so many wonderful features of this park - too numerous to list here. Suffice to say there are (29) playgrounds, (49) statues and (7) bodies of water that grace the landscape. And 2 theaters and a Bandstand! After years of decline during 1960-80, the Park was brought back to it's glory and is now cared for by the Central Park Conservancy - consisting of dedicted donors and the volunteers - who are the wonderful guides on the tours (come rain or shine).","Wonderful Walking Tours in Central Park, NY",RayLeaB-2018,"New York City, New York"

In addition we also joined in the Central Park New Year's Eve midnight run. It was great fun, you have to register for it beforehand but it is well worth it. There were so many people doing it and there is no pressure to run the whole course, many walk it. In total it is about 4 miles. There were drinks available as you jogged round and also a mini disco - great fun, would highly recommend it. The park is also great to just sit and watch the world go by, along with a pretzel and a coffee!",Just Amazing,Sally J,"Ramsbottom, United Kingdom"

You can’t ride your bikes everywhere so have to dismount to see certain sites. there are fast and slow lanes, be prepared to be shouted at if you accidentally end up in a running lane (even if you’ve only stopped to look at map!) You can cycle the whole park in 2hrs with stops for photo Op’s. Will definitely go back and spend more time exploring on foot!

Central Park,New York City,19-Nov,19-Nov,875,70,1,5,"Central Park is a glorious place to sit and watch people. But before we could do that, we first had to move through the horse drawn carriage vendors, hawking their fares for $2-$6 a minute. Once in, we breathed a sigh of relief. We were able to look at the autumn leaves - oranges and yellows - late in the season (on 11/11/19). We walked under the Dip Rock Arch, by artists displaying their wares. We strolled by people ice skating, and families riding the carousel. We ambled down the Mall & Literary Walk with statues of famous authors on either side. Vendors and musicians also occupied the sides of this walk. At Naumburg Bandshell, which was empty, we sat on one of the benches to rest. We listened to live music from further down the path. We have state & county parks where we live, but Central Park seems alive. It changes with the seasons and with the people enjoying its beauty.

Our horse Murphy was adorable and we were well looked after and our driver was very informative. Lots of photo opportunities and we were thankful to be driven around this huge park after so much walking around New York. We were pestered by salespeople trying to sell us bike rides outside the park but decided to go direct to the carriages which was a far nicer experience.

Central Park,New York City,19-Nov,19-Oct,3,1,0,5,"I'm a born and raised New Yorker so have the advantage of anytime access to Central Park. My first experience as a kid was the Zoo with my parents and then a walk through the park from East to West with a lunch of a hot dog, a NY pretzel, and a can of soda. Heaven! When I was a bit older and allowed to travel from Queens to Manhattan with friends, we explored the Park from the South East Corner (near the Plaza Hotel) and up into the Park to the lake where we would pile into a row boat and terrorize the ducks. Late teens brought us to more open spaces where ""be-ins"" were the happening thing, with music, flower power and, other stuff (don't tell my parents!). When we decided girls were more than a little interesting, long walks up the Mall and back in the boat. With the right girl, it was the DelacorteTheatre for Shakespeare in the Park. Come winter, head for the ice skating rink. I worked for years a few blocks from the 65th Street entrance on the West side. More times than I can count, I'd bring lunch to the park and find a bench, a rock, or bit of grass to sit on to clear my head of the morning's work load. Nowdays, with work behind me, we find ourselves going to the Park for concerts, to meet friends for a stroll before dinner, or maybe to go back to places we've spent getting to know ourselves and remember how much we've enjoyed this place. As a tourist with limited time, seek the highlights, walk through the Park East to West or the other way and explore the neighborhoods on either side. East is different than West. The West side offers more restaurants in proximity to the Park. A nice walk is from the Metropolitan Museum (a must see) across the Park to the Museum of Natural History and the Planetarium. You will be exhausted by then but walk West one Avenue and you'll find many good restaurants to sit, relax, drink, and eat.

We started by taking a taxi from our hotel at 7th Ave and 53rd St to Central Park West and 81st Street. Then we walked back to our hotel through the park. During our walk we visited the Diana Ross Playground (donated by D Ross after the riots during one of her concerts), Belvedere Castle, The Ramble, The Loeb Boathouse, Alice in Wonderland and Hans Christian Andersen Statues, and the Central Park Zoo. I would definitely recommend doing it this was because if you start from the south end of the park and walk north you might be too tired to make the return walk, plus going from 81st to 59th streets is mostly downhill.

Central Park,New York City,19-Dec,19-Nov,13,1,0,5,"Central Park is a wonderful oasis in the center of a busy city. But it's more than just nice trees and paths. There are a ton of activities to do and places to visit. The park is divided into five sections from downtown to uptown by crosstown streets. Visit the Central Park Conservancy website for an interactive map or download free PDF maps that show playgrounds, running paths and more. I usually visit the park with tourist friends so we visit places close to midtown. The Carousel, Central Park Zoo, Children's Petting Zoo, Wolman Rink are all below 66th Street. Closer to 72nd Street is Bethesda Fountain and Terrace which is right near the lake where you can rent a rowboat. There's also a smaller boathouse where you can rent a remote control sailboat to run around a pond. Very fun to do with kids. Moving uptown, near 79th Street there's Belvedere Castle and the Delacorte Theater where Shakespeare in the Park is performed each summer. If you're in this part of the park, stop off at the Met or Museum of Natural History since they're on the east and west sides of the park at 79th Street. Above 86th Street, the park is filled with a reservoir which I think is an emergency water supply for the city. Past the reservoir at 96th Street are sports fields, ice skating rink and a pool along with more playgrounds and open spaces. Throughout the park it's easy to find a quiet place to sit down, read or sun. During the winter it's less crowded but you can still always find people jogging or skiing if there's snow. For people with mobility issues, the park is very easy to navigate. There's plenty of paths so it's easy to walk around and many paths are lined with benches so you can rest between walks. There's some hills but nothing substantial. The Bethesda Fountain and Terrace has the largest set of stairs and it's about two flights. There are often vendors in the park selling food and drinks in case you get thirsty (though water is overpriced). Although the park is big, it's usually a quick walk to Central Park West (the west border) or Fifth Avenue (the east border) so you can find your way out. Definitely worth your time and most parts are free!",Wonderful place to relax in the middle of Manhattan,AuntStacyP,"New York City, New York"

I spent almost 6 hours strolling the Park top to bottom. It must be amazing in the summer and fall.

I also like Cleopatra's needle, yes from ancient Egypt, which stand's outside the Metropolitan Museum of Art. There are four in the world. One is also in London on the Thames just north of Big Ben.

To rent a bicycle, there is a shop on the south side of Central Park, about a block away. I'm sure there are more I'm unaware of.

Central Park,New York City,19-Dec,19-Oct,372,67,1,4,"While I wouldn't say Central Park is my least favorite place in NYC, its certainly not my favorite. Call me old fashioned but when someone uses the term ""park"" my mind goes to words like peaceful, natural, relaxing, and/or clean. If you want to enjoy Central Park, then you need to get rid of the fairy tale movie clips we have all grown up with (Home Alone, Serendipity, 27 Dresses, etc) and accept reality. First you will never be alone. Wherever you go, there is guaranteed to be a crowd, group of teenagers, and street-artists at any picture worthy spot. So if you are looking for peace and quiet, accept that it just does not exist here. Secondly, be aware of the scams to avoid - mainly pedicabs, their rates are ridiculous for the distance and the little time spent. Ask any true New Yorker, the best way to get around is by riding a bike. NYC is full of bike rental stands that are very reasonably priced - need I say more. Lastly, get to used the uncomfortable smells - especially the questionable ones. NYC is a reality that is amazing to experience but throws many into shell shock without warning.",Nothing Like the Movies,Helen Marie,

There really are some beautiful windy paths which are best explored by foot to appreciate. Bikes are great to explore the Park by road if you don’t have much time. Thankfully, there are a few discreet toilets scattered about the park which allowed us to enjoy taking our time to explore this vast area, alongside the many cute squirrels scurrying about the place. There are lots of runners, we even saw one man on skis and Santa on a bike on our second visit! Belvedere Castle in the middle of the Park is very pretty. You can climb a short, very narrow staircase for free up to the top where you’ll find excellent views. There was also some live music here which added to the atmosphere. The Obelisk was good to see and read about it’s history and we found the Alice in Wonderland statue was the hardest to find. It’s a beautiful park with a beautiful backdrop.

I was surprised that it was all still “ very grey” .. and it was very cold , so we didn’t venture far, on this , our return visit we intended to take a horse and carriage ride , especially as it was almost Christmas . The prices really stopped us , we were quoted €180 for the carriage ride which seemed excessive as there were only two of us . I couldn’t justify the cost ...and as we are fit and well enough to walk we did just that . We probably spent around 2 hours walking, then we found a coffee shop and sat looking at the wildlife . We started to talk to another couple who were also visiting and we exchanged our thoughts about New York . One of the nicest things that stood out the whole visit was the lack of dog mess left on the floors and hardly any chewing gum or litter ... well done New Yorkers .

From the sites and views of the skyline and celebrities’ high rise homes surrounding it, to the famous movie/TV show moments filmed in it, to the overall experience of the park itself - it’s impossible to see the whole place in a short time. We were approached by a Pedi-Cab driver upon walking into the park (as I’m sure most people are), and let him give his spiel. He was friendly and hilarious, and was willing to give us a deal due to the exchange rate on the Canadian Dollar. It was a chilly day and we had already walked several thousand steps, so we agreed to the trip. Honestly, best decision we made during our time in NYC. He was so informative and funny; he played music in lead up to certain points of the park (Friends theme song heading up to the fountain, Let It Be on the way to the John Lennon memorial), and made sure to stop at many places, volunteering to take photos of us for our memory banks. We also had blankets to keep us warm. The trip was supposed to be 45 min long, which turned into 90 minutes, with him even driving us back to Times Square afterwards!

Central Park,New York City,20-Jan,19-Nov,525,344,0,4,"This huge, picturesque park is very well maintained and we felt surprisingly safe. You can easily spend half a day here and there is something for everyone - cycle paths, sports areas, open air theatres, play grounds, a zoo, lakes, dozens of statues, wildlife and several cafes (best to use the toilets here). The signage isn’t great so, to make the most of your visit, do some research and take a map! If you are pressed for time or want to save your feet, hire a bike, tuk-tuk or horse and carriage. Despite a sign designating it as a “quiet space”, the Strawberry Fields memorial erected at the behest of Yoko Ono was sadly mobbed by people queuing to get selfies of themselves posing on the Imagine mosaic, as well as buskers and souvenir vendors. The stunning Spanish-style Bethesda Terrace and lake is another “must do” if you are in the park. Between the two grand staircases, there is a vaulted arcade with a colourful Minton tile ceiling and walls covered with trompe l'oeil paintings. We were lucky that the Angel of the Water fountain was still working (it is turned off in in winter). Sadly, at the time of our visit, the Belvedere was closed for restoration and the musical clock over the entrance to the zoo wasn’t working (the cute bronze animal band is supposed to play on the hour and half hour). The nostalgic and intricately detailed 11-foot bronze Alice in Wonderland is by far the best statue in the park and is popular with adults as well as kids. It features Alice sitting on a giant mushroom, surrounded by the Mad hatter, White Rabbit, Cheshire Cat, Dormouse and her cat Dinah, all atop a granite circle inscribed with a line from Lewis Carroll’s The Jabberwocky. The park also has a large bronze statue of Hans Christian Andersen depicting the author seated on a bench, reading from The Ugly Duckling. Here, on Saturday mornings during the summer, children are treated to an hour-long story-telling session featuring readings of Andersen's well-known tales.",Iconic park with lots to see and do,top-trippers,"Heswall, United Kingdom"

I think in the summer months you could use most of the day having a lovely stroll around but as we visited in January and it was quite cold a few hours was more than enough time x My only criticism would be the difference in the prices with the cabs, my tour started out at $350 for one cab for three people and I eventually paid $150 which speaking to some people we met this was still expensive so my advice if you don’t want to have a good walk around the park make sure you are prepared to haggle over the price !",A beautiful bit of green ,Brandymate,"Little Sutton, United Kingdom"

There are many wonderful sights within the park, so - if you have time - do a little research to see what areas might be of interest.

Central Park,New York City,20-Feb,19-Nov,385,160,0,5,"Central Park is one of our favourite spaces in New York City and we make an effort to stroll through it every time that we visit NYC. It is simultaneously a beautiful oasis of calm and a centre of activity in the heart of busy Manhattan. While the Park attracts many tourists, particularly near Central Park South, it also is a great way to get a glimpse of New Yorkers relaxing - reading, chatting, strolling, jogging, picnicking, rowing, cycling, playing, dog walking and just people watching. Walking across the Park gives you a vivid sense of the noticeable differences between New Yorkers from the more proper East Side (east of Fifth Avenue) and those from the more relaxed West Side. If you have the opportunity, attending an outdoor concert or theatrical performance in the Park is a memorable experience that will last a lifetime.

Central Park,New York City,20-Mar,19-Sep,15,1,0,5,"Central Park became one of our highlights in New York. It is huge but some London parks are competitive in that sense. However, the atmosphere is livelier and some of the views of the skyscrapers are astounding, although this was undoubtedly aided by the beautiful weather in August. Even the buskers are impressive. I would strongly recommend hiring bikes. You can cycle around in an hour and a lot of it is downhill but you can see a lot more this way. Only a few short parts are uphill but it is suitable for amateur, leisure cyclists. I would avoid the sellers who come offering bikes, go online and look for vouchers or deals; you can find 2 bikes for 5 hours for a total of $25. We did not get the chance to visit the zoo or lido which we would do if ever we go again. This place is a must-visit in New York.",An unbelievable day out,Panda & Fig,"London, United Kingdom"

There are plenty of horse and carriages if you want a leisurely ride around the park, they have prices on the side of the carriages but they are negotiable. Alternatively, there are lots of rickshaws too but they seemed very expensive this time. The carriage and rickshaw drivers all give you information about the park during the trip and they point out celebrity homes too. There is a plaque on the floor in the Strawberry Fields part remembering John Lennon, it is close to where his apartment is. There is often someone playing the guitar there, singing Beatles songs.

It is composed by different parts, such as the great lawn, the reservoir and the Lake, and there are scattered here and there several statues or pieces of art.

To visit the entire park you need several hours, if not an entire day, as there is so much to see and do, and sometimes it's nice just to relax and enjoy life. We spent a good amount of time reading the inscriptions by citizens on benches; some of them were sad because regarded dead people, some other made me smile because they were about people who fell in love in that spot.

Central Park,New York City,20-Nov,19-Dec,34,42,3,5,I’ve visited in May 2018 and March 2019. If you’ve never visited Central Park turn you’ve definitely missed out. The pedicab tours are a great way to see the park and when you’ve done that spend some time walking around on foot to see the bits where the pedicabs and horse carriages can’t go. The Alice in wonderland statue is my favourite along with Strawberry Fields and the John Lennon imagine mosaic. Take a walk along the Mall and the amazing Bethesda Terrace and the beautiful Minton tiles at the Bethesda Arcade. Walk over to cherry hill for some amazing views across the lake. There are plenty of benches to sit on and people watch.,A beautiful green space in the amongst the hustle and bustle of a city,vix_36,"Liverpool, United Kingdom"

We really enjoyed our afternoon here. Just be aware some people think they don't need to wear a mask because they are outdoors. I understand taking the mask off briefly to eat, drink or take a picture, but walking around without a mask really is not a great way to show respect to other people's health and well-beings. If those runners can wear a mask when they are jogging, you, of course, can wear a mask while walking.",Good place for a walk but be aware of people not wearing masks,BHUANG69,"New Providence, New Jersey"
Central Park,New York City,20-Nov,19-Dec,6,2,0,4,"Central Park is so relaxing and really associable by the subway and the gardens are amazing. But the only downfall is its history I mean like what it was built by supremacists that got rid of a black and some white community which actually they got along and they had to just destroy that relation also Central Park Five and The Mine are just so dark history in a park that seems so innocent.Also, visit was on 2017 january 1",Amazing Place but drak history,DANIEL,"Boston, Massachusetts"

I have visited twice, had a really good experience and you will feel relaxed. Recommendations if you are a traveler be careful with outside cyclist tour people, they might cheat you with rates and won't show the places properly. Rather you can google yourself and if you are strong enough you can walk by. Carry water bottles, biscuits and other basic things which u needed. For travelers, if you have a good time you can spend or you can visit another time as there is a lot of good relaxing places to view. I strongly recommend this is one of the best places in the busiest state.",Best place to visit for relaxing,Ram Shetty,"Bengaluru, India"

Drink in the tranquility of an early morning while looking up at the sky scrapers getting increasingly taller to the south. All seasons are spectacular in all sections but early fall is particularly picturesque. Buskers, walkers, joggers, children’s entertainers, roller skaters, hawkers, jugglers, dogs by the dozens.

Central Park,New York City,19-Oct,19-Oct,32,25,2,5,"I recommend schedule at least one morning or afternoon to enjoying this park. It would be great if you can spend one day on it. Take a bike and ride as much as you can; the lagoon and the reservoir are beautiful places. I took a bike tour for 2 hours and it was a good idea, because I could get a lot of data about this park and then, I returned on foot to stay longer. In October, I could stay there until 9pm and it seemed nice and safe. In my opinion, is one of the most beautiful places in NYC.",You must do it!,Milena S,"Santiago Metropolitan Region, Chile"

Central Park,New York City,19-Oct,19-Sep,5,2,0,3,"We booked the 45 minute Central Park Tour and was looking forward to a memorable carriage ride. Unfortunately, we did not call ahead and thought we would just show up ahead of time. What we found out is there are over 165 carriage operators in the park and finding who you booked with can be a real challenge. We did show up early at the area indicated on our booking confirmation however, there were at least 25 different vendors all lined up in single file against the street curb. We went down the line one after another asking if they had our booking. We had our booking in our Apple wallet and showed it to each one of the operators most of which kept asking who we booked with. I finally called the contact number and he was someone we had asked previously in the line. The attitude was cavalier at best. Once on board and on our way we asked a lot of questions about the park and had a difficult time understanding what he was saying. He was from a foreign country and had arrived 7 years ago. He did take pictures of us at one of the scenic spots which we appreciated. We quietly went back to where we started after about 35 minutes. The confirmation did say contact tour operator so, make sure you follow their instructions.",Call before you go!,Kimo M Keawe,"Kauai, Hawaii"
